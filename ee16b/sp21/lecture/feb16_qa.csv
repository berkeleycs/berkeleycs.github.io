#,Question,Answer(s),,
1,"So, using Phasors allows us to look at the “real” components in our circuit at steady state? Also, it allows us to ignore the initial conditions (the “transient” components)?",Phasors allow you to deal with 'real' (resistors) and 'imaginary' (inductors and capacitors) in steady state.,"And when your inputs are of a specific form (sinusoidal or exponential) they make for quick calculations and allow us to ignore the intial transient components as you say, but only in the case where the real parts of the eigenvalues of the system are < 1.",
2,where did the jwt come from?,Euler’s formula?,"remember from Euler's formula, cos(wt) = 0.5 (e^(jwt) + e^(-jwt))",
3,What if we had multiple frequencies? Would we do this for each frequency and then add them up using superposition?,yes,,
4,Does the prof. mean (U_s tilde) & (I_s tilde conjugate) are source phasors?,live answered,U_s tilde and I_s tilde are source phasors.,
5,Any significant differnce having the tilde above I and V in the KVL and KCL?,it shows that we are dealing with phasors. For time domain you omit the tilde,,
6,What's the intuition behind using summation symbol again?,Sum of the voltages around a loop and the sum of currents going into or out out of a node.,it's showing KCL and KVL can be applied in phasor domain,That’s correct — just adding up all the relevant voltages/currents as is the situation.
7,what is Vs(t) and Is(t)? are these the voltage and current for the entire circuit or just for the input?,those are time domain inputs. The tilde versions are corresponding phasors,,
8,could someone explain the difference between time domain and phasor domain again? i’m still unclear as to what phasors do exactly,Note 4 gives a detailed explanation. Phasors allow you to convert the time domain differential equations into linear equations when inputs are sinusoidal,,
9,Does phasor analysis switch from time domain to frequency domain like fourier. Or is it another domain that we are switchign to?,it is same as Fourier,,
10,"in step 4, would we be able to use gaussian elimination and least squares?","You could if you had a very big circuit and it was needed. It might not be needed for easier circuits. You probably would not use least-squares, since you don’t want approximate solutions, but you want exact solutions.",,
11,why is it V conjugate in the I_el(t)?,"it is a typo, should be I instead of V",,
12,"What is the intuitive meaning of the ""phasor domain""? Does it have a geometric interpretation?","yes, you can draw the signals in complex plane. You will see this in discussions and hw",,
13,is Vin(t) different from Vin? (I'm confused about the expression for Vin(t)),"Vin(t) is the time domain function, with magnitude Vin",,
14,where did we get the equation Vin(t) = Vincost(wt + phi)? is that a given?,"that is the input. It is a cosine wave with magnitude Vin, frequency w and phase phi",so this whole thing is only for inputs with cosine waves?,
15,The part to the right should say vout and not vin on LHS right,it's a voltage divider from Vin to Vout. I don't see any typos,oh oops I misread the equation,
16,Why does the voltage divider equation work,"In AC circuits, the imdence of each element is treated as resistors.",because KCL and KVL applies in phasor domain,
17,Sorry why do we write it as a function of omega?,that's the angular frequency: omega = 2 * pi * freq. The behavior of the RC circuit depends on the frequency,,
18,Is phasor analyis related to the laplace transform? Its been a while since ive seen them but dont they convert differentials into linear equations also?,laplace is with s. Fourier is with jw. Phasor is indeed related to Laplace and Fourier,,
19,what does the H mean?,H is the transfer function from input to output,,
20,How are we obtaining this angle for Vout and Vin?,Prof will explain soon. Note j covers complex numbers in details.,also Note 4 on phasors shows how to get the angle,
21,What is the intuitive meaning for the phase and the angle you are describing?,"In polar co-ordinates, a complex number is a vector of some magnitude and rotated from X-axis by some angle (phase). Look at Note j and Note 4 for more details.",,
22,how do phasor angles work,live answered,"In polar co-ordinates, a complex number is a vector of some magnitude and rotated from X-axis by some angle (phase). Look at Note j and Note 4 for more details.",
23,What is the physical meaning of the angles?,"In polar co-ordinates, a complex number is a vector of some magnitude and rotated from X-axis by some angle (phase). Look at Note j and Note 4 for more details.",,
24,is H(jw) the transfer function?,yes,,
25,So we care more about the amplitude change than the time delay?,"we care about both, depending on the application. The amplitude change is easier to observe, as you will see in the lab.",,
26,how is the magnitude of h(jw) being found?,Prof went through the derivation. It's basically finding magnitude of a complex number. You can see Note j and Note 4 for more details and examples.,,
27,Are these equations generally applicable or just specific to this problem/case?,always applicable. We are studying the special case of low pass filter. You will see other examples in discussions and hw.,,
28,Where’s the 2 coming from when we find vin and vout? Sorry if this is a dumb question…,Euler's formula: 2 cos(wt) = e^(jwt) + e^(-jwt),Ah right it’s cos(wt) = that / 2 usually got it,
29,I was wondering why omega >> 1/RC causes a low pass filter. Wouldn’t the whole expression omega*RC have to be rather large to cause a filter?,"R and C are constants, omega is the input frequency. w >> 1/RC means wRC >> 1 so the +1 in the denominator becomes negligible. Now magnitude is 1/wRC which is again very small",,
30,Where is the arctan(wRC) coming from again?,Prof is explaining right now. Also refer to Note j and Note 4 for more details and examples,,
31,How did we find w0 again?,w0=1/RC,,
