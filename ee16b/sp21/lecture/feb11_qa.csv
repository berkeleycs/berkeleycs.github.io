#,Question,Answer(s),,
1,what does it mean to be ‘decoupled’?,Decoupled means that the two equations don’t depend on each other — they can be solved independently,,
2,for the KVL equation can we convert Vc(t) into an integral in terms of IL(t) and solve that instead of dealing with a system?,"Yes, however solving for IL(t) would involve solving a second order D.E.",The system is nice since it lets us break the problem down into two first order D.E.s (which we know how to do from pervious weeks),
3,Do we also use the change of basis on the additional constant term Vs(t)?,"The diagonalization method will alter the Vs(t) term, since we would multiply both sides by V^-1",,
4,When is A~ upper triangular instead of diagonal?,live answered,,
5,How do we know x_tilde = Vinverse * x? Why not x_tilde = V * x?,live answered,,
6,Why do we have a y on the vector x hat?,"Not to sure where there was a y, but x hat (I assume this is the same as x tilda) realtes by: x = V * x hat",,
7,"'@Daniel, I was referring to the y in e^y(lambda)nt","I see, I do not believe I caught that term, hopefully we can clarify once the written notes are released",,
8,what does m(t) represent?,"I believe this is a u(t), not m(t)",,
9,"Apolgoies my audio cut out, but why does the right side help us look at the steady state?","The professor is talking about this now, it relates to conditions on lambda",,
10,Why is it “if and only if lambda is less than 0”)?,"Because if lambda is larger than zero than that part won’t decay — if and only if means both directions of the condition matter — if lambda < 0 then it decays, and if lambda >= 0 then it does not. That is what if and only if means.",,
11,how is the input in the form of k/(s-lambda)?,"hmm, the input is not of that form — it is of an exponential form with exponent lambda. But the term you mention shows up in the response to the input.",,
12,So basically Lambda_real determines how the entire exponent will behave as t -> infinity,"Yep exactly, the imaginary term is a oscilating but does not really go anywhere (bounded between 1 and -1). The real term will exponentially decay, grow, or stay constatn depending on lambda",,
13,What does the lamba_r’s mean?,Real part of lambda (if it is complex),,
14,What does he mean by the solutions are e^st ?,"Above, we saw that if lambda_r < 0, then the anoying term goes away and we are left with a multiple times e^st for our output. That is, if we input e^st and lambda_r < 0, then the output will be a constant times e^st",,
15,Why is u tilda a vector of constants and not just a constant? Like ke^st?,"Oh I realized it was a system, nvm!",In a generalized system u need not be a scalar?,thanks!
16,"what if s!=lambda, lambda_real < 0, and s < 0 ?",The interpretation of this is: You input a decaying exponential to a system that natrually decays. This means we will approach 0 as time goes to infinity,,
17,What is the significance and difference between S and Lambda? Why are we examing it as different cases?,"Remember that lambda is a parameter of our system (independent of the input). This could be some function of R or C or L. S is a parameter of our input. We are interested in how we can simplify things if we only look at exponential inputs (e^st) and how we can simplify it depending on the system parameter, lambda",,
18,What exactly are we trying to achieve with this example?,live answered,,
19,Is x tilde a constant?,live answered,,
20,"why did we ignore the u(t), in the whole derivation?","We did not ignore u(t), rather we replaced it with an input u_tilda and an epxonential e^st",,
21,"How did we get that equation (1 up from the line he just wrote, where the constant input vector is introduced?)",I assume you mean the eqaution: u(t) = u_tilda e^st. We got this because we were just talking about what would happend if we input an exponential. This step is simply applying that same 'what if' to a matrix vector system,,
22,"Sorry I just want to make sure I’m getting the big picture here. Are we basically trying to find a vector of outputs based on a d/dt (vector of outputs) = vectors of outputs*some constants + some constant that varies with time. So essentially, from the previous example, instead of using Vs(t), we are introducing a u(t) that depends on time?","We are specifically analyzing this for u(t) = some constant vector * e^st. That is, we want to see if we can simplify the output if we know that the input is an exponential (e^st)",,
23,Why does s != lambda imply that there is no null space?,It means the nullspace is trivial — because all values of s for which it would have a non-trivial nullspace would be eigenvalues of A.,,
24,wouldn't it be more correct to say that the nullspace{sI-A} only contains the zero vector?,Yes that would be a more precise way to say it.,,
25,"dont we need trivia null space for invertibility , does no null space also imply invertibility?",He means trivial nullspace when he says no nullspace.,,
26,why did we substitute x(t) = x~ * e^(st) ?,"Based on the intuition we built in the previous part, we are making the educated guess that if we input u_tilda e^st, then we will output some x_tilda e^st",,
27,"When we say s != lambda here, there are possibly multiple eigenvalues for A, right, so this means s is not any of those eigenvalues?",yes,,
28,Why do we know sI-A has no nullspace by knowing s != lambda?,because all values of s for which it would have a non-trivial nullspace would be eigenvalues of A.,,
29,"Did we prove that the above x(t) is a solution, or that IF there is a solution in the above form THEN we've caluclated what it would be?",We showed that if the input is an exponential of the form constant * e^st then the output will also be an exponential of the form constant * e^st,didn't we just assume that the output is that form though by ignoring half the terms?,
30,"How does this account for initial conditions? It seems like x as a fixed solution depending on s, A, and u which is not possible because initial conditions can vary","Recall x(t) = x_tilde e^st. If we plug in t = 0, we get that x(0) = x_tilde. We can choose x_tilde to match out initial conditions","We are saying that if the eigenvalues of A are less than 0, then the initial conditions are going to die out and in the long term not matter.",
31,"To confirm, this equation we have works when lambda(r) is < 0 and u is in the form constant*e^st?","Also, why would this fail when lambda > 0, wouldn’t the linear algebra still work the same way?",If you had lambda > 0 then the initial condition might not die out and you’ll have to deal with two terms in the exprsession of x(t) at steady state when t to infty.,
32,Why are doing these cahnges right now?,"We are introducing a much simpler way to solve these systems given that our input is of some form, and the eigenvalues of the system are of some form. This will pay off soon, the analysis becomes much easier!",,
33,Why are we representing V and I in this form? How do we know it’s V_tilde e^st,"We are saying: If I(t), V(t) have this form, then we can use these properties of V / I, etc",,
34,can we assume that s is the same for the equations in I(t) and V(t)?,live answered,,
35,is S-impedence like a time delay for the signal going through?,What does it represent?,"It is a little hard to answer this without knowing what S is. Remember that S is a complex number, so this S-impedance can be complex. This is like having a complex resistance. We will see that the magnitude of this S-impedance will be analgous to a pure resistance and the phase of this S-impedance will be related to time delay",
36,"What is the significance of s-impedence? I’m assuming that since s is the parameters of our inputs, the s-impedence of caps and inductors involve s because both caps and inductors care about the change in voltage and current respectively. Whereas in the resistor case, it says the same because it is not dependent on the change in voltage and current","Really good insight there on resistors. Resistance does not behave differently when the input is changing with time. What S-impendance means is that this circuit component (L or C) will actually have a different 'resistance' at different values of s (i.e. the input is changing in different ways). There is also something to be said about delays and S-impedance, but we will get to that",So basically what we’ve shown is that we can simply examine the impedence (because it’s a lin. sys. of eq. and simpler) when looking at any circuits with caps and inductors?,
37,"What is the difference between s and j? I learned in my circuits class at my collumity college that the impedance of a resistor is R. For a capacitor, it’s 1/jC and for an inductor = zL.","I believe you're missing an 'omega' or 'w' term here. In CC, they may have plugged in S = 0 + jw. That is, we treat S as purely imaginary. Once we make that substitution, the formulas from CC should allign with the ones derived",,
38,why are some x~ vectors constant and some dependent of time t? like: what is the difference between x~(t) and x~?,I believe x ~ and x ~(t) are both constants,,
39,"I thought we already figured out what it would look like if the input was e^st, couldn’t we just distribute that to all of the values in x(t)","Yes, what is being proposed is a method that is even simpler than that. Rather, it takes advantage of the property you just mentioned. Hopefully this will become clear soon",,
40,what is the letter subscript after of the form,"If you can, try writing the equation your are refering to",,
41,Wait why would we need to add d/dt x(t) - Ax(t) to the steady state solution?,Answered by prof,,
42,what is meant by adding to the steady state solutions? what are the steady state solutions? I thought we’re just solving this once difeq. I thought we’re solving for x(t) that has real part xr and imaginary xi?,"Steady state solutions are those solutions that we come to after a long time t \to \infty. So we are solving for x(t) but we are interested only in the value for very large t, not the initial transient behavior, but what happens after everything settles down.",,
43,Can we please do an example circuit of this?,live answered,,
44,what is a complex conjugate?,a + bj and a-bj are complex conjugates,,
45,"Phi is a constant, omega is what we’re varying in this case correct?","Nvm sorry I j flipped something in my head, t is varying.",I think you answered this!,
46,what des conjugate mean of u tilda?,"if u tilda = a +jb, then the conjugate of u tilda = a - jb. Just an operation on complex numbers",,
47,are the vectors next to the matrix M row vectors?,"No, I don’t think so, unless I’m misunderstanding your question.",,
48,"intuitively, what might M look like for some given circuit?",Answered by prof,,
49,where did I~ and V~ come from?,These are the phasor terms of I and V. Similar to how u ~ came to be,,
50,Which note covers this lecture's content?,,,
51,Is matrix conjugate defined as the conjugate of all the elements?,yes,,
52,"We use the symbol z to symbolize the s-impedances for each circuit element, right?",live answered,,
