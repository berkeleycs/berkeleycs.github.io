2,"Is the approximation of f(x,u) based on the partial derivative of the function? It appears to be some kind of application of the chain rule?","yes, we’ll see that shortly."
3,What is del?,live answered,it's the curvy d
4,"When we use the Taylor approximation, do we also have to find the interval where the approximation is close to the actual function?",normally yes. but that depends on how much error can u tolerate and how far do you want to get from star points.
5,Do x and f have the same dimension for a reason?,not in general. I think this was just a notation overload.
6,In the previous part how is A a square matrix and B not,it was just a coincidence since f had the same dimension as x. But that doesn’t have to be true in general.
7,"how is f(x, u) = dx/dt? or do we just define it like that?","Yes, remember that for the linear case we had dx/dt = ax+bu so f(x,u) = dx/dt = ax+bu. For nonlinear system, dx/dt would be some nonlinear function of x and u, f(x,u).",thank you!
8,"Sorry why dx/dt = f(x, u) again plz?","Remember that for the linear case we had dx/dt = ax+bu so f(x,u) = dx/dt = ax+bu. For nonlinear system, dx/dt would be some nonlinear function of x and u, f(x,u)."
9,Why do we only look at coefficient of x and not u?
