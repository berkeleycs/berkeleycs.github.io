1,"On the previous problem, when we analyzed an RC circuit with two capacitors, could we have set up the equation so that it represented a second order differentiall equation (and used the characteristic equation to solve)?",live answered,"Yes you could have, though we don't cover that exact method in this course. In lecture, we will show an alternative method which will actually prove why the characteristic equation method works.",,,,
,,,,,,,
2,Could you please enable so that students see all of the questions?,,,,,,
,,,,,,,
3,"what is coupling, de-coupling, and mutual coupling? I dont remember explicitly learning what these characteristics mean and how we know they exist so im confused","We haven’t really talked about coupling in this class, I’m not sure what your question is referring to.",Are you discussing RC coupling or capacitor coupling?,The professor just mentioned we had a few coupled differential equations so we had to do change of variables. I dont know if its RC or capacitor but I dont know either,oh! Coupled differential equations are just equations with multiple variables where teh derivatives depend on not just the variable but on other variable. So like the example in class last time. The variables are ‘coupled’,,
,,,,,,,
4,Why do we need a change of variables?,To get it back into the form of (1) that we know how to solve,,,,,
,,,,,,,
5,"Shouldn't the change of variables be x' = x-u/lambda? otherwise the u doesnt cancel, or am I missing something","Yes, I believe this was just a typo — conceptually, it’s a shift of the variable.",,,,,
,,,,,,,
6,"so for 2), u is a scalar constant and for 3), its a piecewise function?","Yes. If u was not a constant in 2, then the change of variables would not work.",,,,,
,,,,,,,
7,"I am a little confused about this particular concept -- if we are trying to prove that two functions are equal, and we take their difference to form a new equation, z(t), how does d/dt z(0) = 0 imply that d/dt z(t) = 0 for all t>=0?","You need to also include that the initial condition z(0) = 0. Then since the derivatve is 0, it means it will stay at 0 for all time.",This is also the same process as problem 2 on your HW,,,,
,,,,,,,
8,Why isn’t (i + 1)delta include for t is in the set of …?,"u((i+1)delta) will be a different value because that's where the ""jump"" in the piecewise constant function happens","We assume that each interval starts at the delta interval. So the next interval will be [(i+1)delta, (i+2)delta)",,,,
,,,,,,,
9,where’d we get t-idelta from?,"The time elapsed starts at the initial time, idelta",live answered,,,,
,,,,,,,
10,why is it u[i] and then u[i*delta] after we solve (the step leading to the equation boxed in yellow)?,"it's u[i] and u(idelta) so the brackets are like indexing into an array of the constant values and the parenthesis are like a continuous function, i suppose",Student answer is correct,"Okay, are those the same value though?",Yeah,"Yes, u[i] is a constant value which is the value of u in the time intervals [i*delta, (i+1)*delta)",okay thank you!
,,,,,,,
11,why do we know that d/dt(x'(t)) = k x'(t)? do we assume so because it is basically a shift of x(t)?,Where exactly are you seeing this kx(t)? I'm not sure which part you are talking about,"I mean like after changing the variable x(t) to the new variable x'(t) = x(t) + b/a. why do we know that differentiating the new function, x'(t) gives us the same format as differentiating x(t)?",ah. this is because b/a is a constant so the derivative of both sides is the same,"Yeah, I thought since x'(t) = x(t) + b/a, then d(x'(t)) = d(x(t)) = k*x(t) but it is instead k*x'(t). if that makes sense.",,
,,,,,,,
12,"the smaller the delta, the closer the approximation?",yep!,,,,,
,,,,,,,
13,Clarifying question: uc(t) is the actual function and u(i) is out blocky approximation.,"Yes, that is correct, except you use square brackets usually for u[i]","ok thanks, one more thing: how does x(t) tie into this? Am I correct that x(t) is like a placeholder function to solve the differential equation?",x(t) is the solution of the differential equation,"ah, okay ty",,
,,,,,,,
14,so eventually your last input as you approximate delta going to zero is homogenous?,"hmm, not sure I understand your question?",,,,,
,,,,,,,
15,what is the sum term? I cant read some parts of it,^,f,"This was just a brief recap. For the full derivation, read the Dis 3A solutions",,,
,,,,,,,
16,why does this solution not work for negative times?,live answered,,,,,
,,,,,,,
17,Where’d we get e^lambdat - 1 / lambda from ?,ah right I remember it came from the derivation. Sorry!,,,,,
,,,,,,,
18,Theta just represents another variable and it doesn’t have anything to do with angles right?,live answered,,,,,
,,,,,,,
19,why do we need a dummy local variable?,"Its needed for the integral. Since the variable t is in the limits of the integral, we want to use some other variable to integrate.",I think I dont understand how integrals works bc I dont get why we we need some other variable to integrate,,,,
,,,,,,,
20,"yeah I thought since x'(t) = x(t) + b/a,",sorry. Wrong thread.,,,,,
,,,,,,,
21,how is this being tested?,like what am i supposed to be learning bc i lowkey did rly bad in calculus and this isnt like matrices like 16a or anything,"Calculus is going to be important in this class unforutnately :(. The matrices are about to come soon, in the next part of the lecture and following lectures. Trying to brush up on some calc might be a very useful investment of time.",pnp time (but for real thank you professor i’ll def do some extra homework),,,
,,,,,,,
22,Will we be going over Laplace transforms in this class?,No. Laplace transforms are in EE 120 and EE 128,,,,,
,,,,,,,
23,"On the exam, can we use these derivations directly or do we need to derive them ourselves? Thanks","Such questions are better for Piazza. In general, you may use solutions that you have already derived, unless of course you are asked to derive them.",,,,,
,,,,,,,
24,How did the professor get the V_out again?,live answered,,,,,
,,,,,,,
25,how does 5) work. where do we get x(t) from from uc = ke^(st),You need to use equation (1) and calculate the integral,isnt equation 1 just the x(t) = x(0) e^(lambda t) relationship. is there supposed to be an integral there?,,,,
,,,,,,,
26,where is the Vout eqn coming from?,live answered,,,,,
,,,,,,,
27,How did the professor get the purple part,By solving the integral in equation (1). The steps aren't shown here,,,,,
,,,,,,,
28,how miuch of the trig identities and manipulations do we need to udnerstand in 6),"We won't expect you to memorize trig identities, but you should definitely be familar with trig as later on we will deal with a ton of sines and cosines.",,,,,
,,,,,,,
29,what trig identity was used to get the numeratot in the purple circle?,live answered,,,,,
,,,,,,,
30,what is the purpose of 5 again?,Just to show how to solve inputs that are exponential.,,,,,
,,,,,,,
31,"For that Vout(t) equation, how is there a Vin if the input into the differential equation was a function Vin(t)? Or am I misinterpreting this?","I couldn't see what the equation was, but don't worry too much about the exact solution.  It was just an example.",,,,,
,,,,,,,
32,In my previous diffeqs class we worked a lot with Laplace tranforms. Is there a reason we don't use Laplace transforms to solve systems of equations in this class?,"You will see one application of Laplace transforms later (phasors) but we don't cover the transform directly in class. Also, generally you don't need the Laplace transform to solve systems, but you use it to solve higher order differential equations.",,,,,
,,,,,,,
33,why can we use V on d/dt x?,The derivative of x is also a vector. So we are just doing matrix vector multiplication,,,,,
,,,,,,,
34,"To confirm here, we are solving for x(t) correct? Or the derivative?",Yes we are solving for x(t),,,,,
,,,,,,,
35,"what makes x~(t) ""nicer"" than x(t)?",is it easier to formulate a solution to the diff eq for x~?,Yes. On the previous page it was shown that the new A tilde matrix is V^-1AV and we want it to be diagonal so the x tilde equations are easy to solve.,"ah, okay. this is because a diagonal matrix just scales each of the values in a vector by a constant right? so the ODE is much less complex?",,,
,,,,,,,
36,when would V(inv) * A * V be upper triangular?,"For certain bases V. We will cover one such basis later on in the course. If you want to look it up now, it is called the Schur form.",,,,,
,,,,,,,
37,how does V-1 * the [lambda1V1...] = to the diagonal matrix. isnt the  [lambda1V1...] already a diagonal matrix,"No that matrix has columns lambda1v1, lambda2v2. It is easier to see by showing that V * Lambda = [lambda1v1  lambda2v2 .... lambdanvn] so that multiplying by V^-1 gives you the Lambda matrix",,,,,
,,,,,,,
38,"Say we had a series of 3 RCs, we would want our x(t) to basically be a vector with a colleciton of vouts from each RC correct?",live answered,,,,,
,,,,,,,
39,how is the system second-order? didn't we only have d/dt? not d^2/dt^2?,"It is second order since the x vector has 2 dimensions, or A is 2x2. You will see on later homeworks that these 2 definitions of second order are equivalent.",,,,,
,,,,,,,
40,Does the order of the eigenvalues in the omega matrix matter?,"no, as long as the order of the eigenvectors in your V matrix correspond.",,,,,
,,,,,,,
41,"why is it det(lambda*I-A) when before it was written (A-lambda*I)? (confused about the relation between these two, are they both zero/equal?","Since we are setting the determinant equal to 0, it doesn't matter which one you use. You will end up with the same eigenvalues even though you will have negated determinants","you just multiply both sides by negative 1, it’s equal",,,,
,,,,,,,
