#,Question,Answer(s),
1,Make sure everyone sees the questions.,,
2,what is DC?,live answered,
3,is something happening on screen? Mine is fronzen I think.,maybe try logging back in?,
4,"so inductors can be thought of as ""current capacitors?""",The store enerygy in form of magnetic field if that’s what you mean,
5,What does the H vector represent?,the  magnetic field,
6,I’m not really sure I understand the intuition behind it “fighting the change the current” could you explain that again?,"If you change current aprubtly, its voltage would be large and it would fight the same way that the capacitor’s would have fought change of voltage",
7,which way do the H and B point?,in the picture drawn its south west :),
8,would charge be L*I?,There is no charge in an inductor. It’s magnetic flux.,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductor
9,I thought B represents magnetic field. Isn’t it?,"The definition of H is H = B/μ − M, where B is the magnetic flux density, a measure of the actual magnetic field within a material considered as a concentration of magnetic field lines, or flux, per unit cross-sectional area; μ is the magnetic permeability; and M is the magnetization.",
10,"Is it fair to say these inductors don't actually  ""store"" current, but rather store magnetic charge that induces current?",live answered,
11,"Sorry just to double confirm DC —> open ckt in a capacitor because DC means constant current and since I = C*dv/dt, dv/dt = 0 and so I across the cap = 0?",live answered,
12,doesn't that RL circuit have constant current?,"if vs is constant, yes",
13,Why is a resistor necessary in the simple inductor circuit?,because in DC inductor will be a short circuit. You can’t short a voltage source since the current would be infinity,
14,Why is V_L(0) = 0?,"for t <= 0, di/dt=0 and therefore voltage across the inductor was zero.",
15,Why does V_L evaluate to 0 at time 0 again?,"for t <= 0, di/dt=0 and therefore voltage across the inductor was zero.",
16,Why is V_s(t) = 0 when t > 0?,that’s the input. Think of it as the assumption of the problem.,
17,How did you get the time constant?,tau is inverse of R/L by definition.,
18,what’s the reasoning behind current being constant when Vs = 1V for a long time?,"Nothing is really changing in the circuit for a long time. Therefore, the current is not changing (hence constant)",
19,"Could someone clarify to me the difference/relation between energy and charge?

my current understanding is:
-energy is the work required to move something 1 meter against 1 unit of force

-charge is a measurement of electromagnetic potential brought on by the positive and negative ""pulls"" of protons and electrons

is it the presence or the change in charge that results in energy being transfered? I'm unsure how these two intrisic properties relate to each other.",Think of electric energy as the work required to move the charge of 1 C by 1 meter. A capacitor for example stores charge on its plates and this act will result in an electric field which potentially can move any charge in-between the plates of the capacitor.,
20,Can someone please explain how the voltage just “switches” after t is greater than 0 to 0 V?,Vs(t) is something that we have control over. So we change it from 1V to 0V at time zero. Think of it as the assumption of the problem.,
21,Capacitors at steady state have a current of 0 right?,correct,
22,are the Vc(0)=1V and IL(0)=0A a given in this hypothetical situation?,"No, These are concluded based on the fact that Vs(t) = 1V for a long time before t = 0",
23,where did the negative sign come from before 1/L * Vc(t)?,live answered,
24,"So at t=0, dispite the voltage dropping to 0 across Vs, we still have a voltage of 1 across Vc due to the inductor fighting current change? If this is true, why is there no current actross the inductor at t=0 due to the capacitor being charged up when t<0?",there will be a current for t >= 0 but an epsilon after t = 0 charge cannot move very quickly. so current is zero.,
25,Why is V_L  = -V_C?,KVL with vs = 0,
26,isn’t IL(0) = 0A? how would IL change once the current source is removed?,I believe you meant voltage source. IL at t=0 is zero. Over time the charges stored on the capacitor can move through the inductor implying some current through it.,
27,"These complex numbers don’t really have any physical meaning right, it’s just to help us with the process of diagnolization ?",Think of them as the mathematical tools for analyzing the behavior. So your final time-domain answer should not include any complex expression.,
28,Why do we use j for sqrt(1) instead of i? Can I use i instead? My other classes all use i.,"In circuits, i is often used for current, so this is to avoid confusion.",
29,"if you get complex eigenvalues, will they always be a pair (a complex number and its conjugate?)",live answered,
30,why does 2nd row of (A - (lambda)j) * v1 not equal 0?,it is. do your math again: 1 + j**2 = 0,
31,why does v_2 first element have to be 1?,live answered,
32,why is the first entry of v2 1?,live answered,
33,won’t this adhoc way work with any matrix for finding eigenvectors? Can we use this instead of finding the nullspace on the exams?,"yes, unless otherwise mentioned.",
34,why is x=j?,x is the second entry of the eigenvector — so using the second row of the matrix equation gives you that?,
35,Wait so v^-1 * A * v = [e-value _1 0 0 e-value_2],Yes,
36,If we swapped v^-1 and v would we still have the same effect?,"We would not, they play specific roles — as the prof just said AV = LV = VL (Since L is diagonal). So L = V^-1 A V",
37,why is Vc(0) = 1V?,"Vs(t) = 1V for a long time for t<0. So the cap charges up and reaches steady state, which gives Vc(0)=1V",
38,Apologies I should’ve clarified my question more. I meant as in if we say going from x —> x_tilde required multiplying x by v and going from x_tilde —> x required multiplying x_tilde by v^-1 would that be ok?,"yes, that’s a correct statement.",
39,"Just to clarify, odd functions are reflected across y=-x and even are reflected across y?",live answered,
40,could you explain how you got x tildi t again,live answered,
41,from when you got j/2 e^jt,live answered,
42,is the calculation for Vinv correct? i think the signs for the second column should be switched,,
43,"Would any methods for solving ODEs, learned from Math 54, be acceptable on the exams?",,
