2,What is the difference between the frequency domain vs the phasor domain like we studied earlier in the semester?,They are sometimes used interchangabley. But from what was thought phasor of a signal is the representative of that signal at a particular frequency. As you change the frequency the phasor is going to change.
3,"purely real and prurely imaginary numbers are complex as well, right?",Yes
4,"this might be a dumb question but why is [1,2] a complex vector? I thought all entries must be complex for it to be a complex vector?",real numbers are also complex numbers with an imaginary part = 0.
5,How did we take conjugate transpose of a scalar?,Do we just treat it as a 1-vector?,which scalar are you asking about? both u and v were complex vectors.,"When we took (<v, u> )*, isn't <v, u> a scalar?"
6,What is the significance of these roots of unity?,live answered
7,"if 1 is a root of unity, isn't that expression false?",live answered
8,how did we go from roots of unity to here?
9,"Question: for real numbers, isn't it the case that a symmetric matrix is rank defficient?",no not at all. think of the identity
