2,Do we have to do multiple binary classifications if we have more than 2 labeles?,"Depends on the classification algorithm. That approach can work but sometimes there is a simpler way to generalize to multi-label classification, like if you are using logistic regression."
3,Isn't what we're doing in lab with PCA a form of non-binary classification? What makes this binary method better/different?,"Not sure if its better, but its different since we are not reducing the size of our data, like you did with PCA. Also this is learning the optimal w while using PCA + centroids has no learning and is just taking the average.","Ah got it, thanks"
4,"Just curious, do we ever end up using gradient decent with a cost function in this class?",Not in this class. That is 127 and 189,"okay, thanks"
5,"is it possible that this setup yields a w that minimizes the sum of the errors but the sign is actually wrong most of the time, since its being squared.  Like if something has the label +1 but our w outputs some small negative number wouldn’t it be considered good even though its really not?","If you are talking about the least squares cost function, then in your case w would be chosen to be better if it was a positive number. Because you first take the difference then square it, not the other way around."
6,"Does a better cost function improve w, or its runtime, or both?",Usually just w
7,For what applications would a logarithmic cost function have advantages?,Well log probability is used a lot as a maximization objective in a lot of ML algorithms.
8,What is the point of using this exponential function? Is it to map all the outputs to the positive reals and make error exponentially more significant the larger it is?,"It is to punish the cost based off the sign, or which side of the boundary it is on, moreso than how far it is away from the boundary."
9,"How is C(xi^TW*, li) a constant again?",x_i^Tw is a scalar and so is l_i. The cost function is just a function of some scalar that returns a scalar. You saw both the least squares and exponential cost functions.,"w* is also a fixed operating point, and xi and li are given for the data point so that makes the scalar a constant."
