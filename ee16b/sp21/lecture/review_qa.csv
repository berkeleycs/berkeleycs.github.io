2,Will the slides be posted?,https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YVRKNc9WoMG0iALvXc_M-O46hoDOLRDvVra7F95f87c/edit?usp=sharing
3,is U orthonormal or not?,"Not sure if this was answered live already, but yes — since we use gram-schmidt to build out the basis U, it is orthonormal"
4,How do you know what vectors to pad with to perform Gram Schmidt?,live answered
5,shouldn’t the top right entry be scalar in this case of 3 x 3?,live answered
6,will we be required to do many recursion steps on the exam?,No. You only need to know how do to do it up to the 3x3 case — which the discussion has an example
7,are V* and V transpose the same thing?,"Almost — V* represents the ""conjugate transpose,"" meaning that if V contains complex numbers, you also have to take the conjugate of them. But, if V is real, then yeah they are the same"
8,What note does the pseudoinverse correspond to?,Its not really a note but a derivation that arised from minimum energy control
9,In what case is the pseudoinverse used?,live answered
10,What would the formula for D look like if we were using V instead of U?,live answered
11,Is quadratic approximation in scope for the final?,Yes
12,What’s a good hw question to practice quadratic approx.?,live answered
13,How is this binary classification different from the classifying we used PCA for? Are they the same?,live answered
14,What does DFT stand for :'(,Discrete Fourier Transform!
15,I might’ve missed this but why don’t we need to multiply the terms by root 6? assuming the U matrix terms are 1/root(6) times all the e terms. Or did we not normalize U for this problem?,live answered
