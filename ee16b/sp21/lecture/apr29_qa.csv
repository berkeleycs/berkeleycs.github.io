2,"to summerize, we basically divide the imaginary unit circle into N segments each 2pi/N radians?","precisely, we do exactly that (starting at 0 radians)"
3,How exactly do we go about choosing the number of roots of unity?,"I think you are refering to N, the number of points on the unit circle. In the context of the DFT (we will see the connection later hopefully), N represents how long our time signal is.",Yep I was referring to N^ and got it thank you
4,This circular property of imaginary exponents of e is analogous to modular arithmetic no?,"Yeah really similar, cool how that works"
5,"For the 0 case, does this mean that we only have real components in our signal?","For the 0 case, we are representing things that do not change. We haven't talked yet about the connection between the DFT and realness of our signal, that will come in 120"
6,Is this always true: the negative of a frequency will always result in a phase shift of 90 or pi/2?,"Depends: take cos(f * t) and sin(f * t). If we replace f with -f, the cos wave behaves the exact same but the sine wave will phase shift by pi"
7,why are we dividing the vector of omegas by root N and not just N? isn't N the magnitude?,"I believe the magnitude is sqrt(N). As a sanity check, lets look at the first column. It is just 1 repeated N times. The magnitude of a vector full of N copies of 1 is sqrt(N)","Ah, okay that makes sense. I guess I was thinking taxi-cab distance instead of Euclidean haha"
8,Is x[0] in capital x different that x[0] in little x?,Yeah X[0] is not equal to x[0]. x[0] is the first sample of your time signal. X[0] has an intersting interpretation that we will get to soon
9,is the U matrix always symmetric? So Uinv = UT = U?,"2 things going on here: Firstly, U is symmetric so U = U^T.  Second, U^-1 = conjugate(U^T)",I think U^-1 = U^T = U iff U is orthonormal and symmetric
10,"How do we know the signal is going to be split into frequencies with multiples of 2pi/N, for that specific value of N rather than any value of N",We choose N = length(time signal)
11,"Just as a sanity check, if u were in R^3 then we would have a 0 freq. coefficient, a 2pi/3 freq. coefficient, and a 4pi/3 freq. coefficient?","Yep, thats right exactly 3 frequency components spaced by 2pi/3",awesome
12,I’m confused why 0 has no coefficient?,"0 represents: Is there a constant/average value in our signal? Is there an offset? The answer is no, a cosine wave is centered at 0, so there is no offset"
13,"Apologies, but why were we expecting a high magnitude at (N-1) I kinda missed the explanation","I think we expected high magnitudes at index 1 since that represents the frequency of (1) * 2 pi / N, which is the frequency of our cosine wave"
14,"In the code, shouldn't 1/N be 1/sqrt(N)?","Ah yes, this is a subtlety in the DFT computation. Numpy uses a different DFT basis matrix, so we need a different scaling factor. Same answer tho","ah, interesting"
15,what if you had sine within another sine?,"The magnitude of the DFT would show 4 peaks: 2 for the first sine, and 2 for the second sine"
16,"Just a curious question, in Math 54 we are doing continuous Fourier transformations over an interval, and we end up projecting our functions onto the span of sine cosine functions of varying frequency. Does this DFT have any relation to orthogonal projections of functions onto other functions?","Yes absolutely, we are doing exactly that but for discrete signals (the math is much more familiar and nicer for discrete signals over continuous ones). We are changing our basis to that of sines and cosines (complex exponentials). The way we can think of this change of basis is projecting our discrete time signal onto complex exponential signals if different frequencies","I'm thinking maybe not since we are forming our fourier equation based on constant fixed points and not a continuous functions, so perhapse it's less projecting and more best-fitting",oh sorry I sent before I saw your response,"got it, so it is projection, and the complex exponential serves as both the sine and cosine components of the span we are projecting our points onto. cool stuff"
