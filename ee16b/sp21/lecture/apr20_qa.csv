2,why do we want dx/dt ? (vector x),"The systems of equation basically governs the behavior of our system (the pendulum), so we might want to solve for the states (x1 and x2) based on the differential equations"
3,"why is the second equation our f(x1, x2)?","we defined the second equation to be some function f with x1 and x2 as variables, i.e. f(x1, x2)"
4,"Just to clarify we are only considering dx2/dt as our f(x1, x2)?","yes, that’s how we defined f",Would it be possible to do a vector version of f that includes dx1/dt as well?,"in this case, we don’t need to do anything to dx1/dt since it’s linear (so we don’t need to linearize it further)"
5,"all eigenvalues must be in (-1,1)",Could you specify your question a bit more?,I have no question...I intended to type it into the chat only
6,Why is it that k^2/m^2 is necessarily greater than 4g/l? (How do we know the root is real as opposed to being imaginary/complex?),"i believe it doesn’t have to be, but for continous systems, the imaginary part of the eigenvalues doesn’t affect the stability of the system (we are good as long as the real part is <0), so we don’t need to worry about the imaginary case","Ah, I see thanks."
7,"I apolgize, my wifi cut out for a sec. Would it be possible to explain why the real parts are always negative?","because if the square root term is real, it’s magnitude has to be smaller than k/m and it’s positive. -(k/m) + (a positive term with magnitude smaller than k/m) = (a positive term)"
8,why do we care about when sin(x1) = 0? is there something special at these points? or are we just examining these arbitrary points?,"In this particular system, these are the equilibrium points. If the equilibrium points are not obvious for some system, you need to solve for them first"
9,can we still control it to become stable?,live answered,live answered
10,"so just clarifying we found equlibirum points by setting x1,x2 = 0 then proved which one is stable?",live answered
11,why again is it unstable if the eigenvalue is positive and stabe when its negative? is it because of  lambda being in the exponent of the solved diff eq?,This is how you determine stability for continuous time systems
12,"We found these operating points more or less by inspection, right?","In this particular system you can, but in general probably not"
13,What does the cost function mean exactly?,live answered
14,Apologies if I missed it but why aren’t we using linear?,In general using only linear approximation might over simplifies the problem
