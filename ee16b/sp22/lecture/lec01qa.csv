29,Why is the threshold negative?,That is the threshhold value of a PMOS when in fabrication. Theres no reason — the devices works that way and you’ll see why it is useful,01/18/2022 16:19:17,01/18/2022 16:21:42,Thanks!,01/18/2022 16:19:17,01/18/2022 16:23:40

42,What does Vthp represent again?,pmos threshhold voltage,01/18/2022 16:33:05,01/18/2022 16:33:40
43,is PMOS on because Vdd >= |Vthp|?,Yes,01/18/2022 16:33:55,01/18/2022 16:34:14
44,What is V threshold in this case? How does he know whether 0 is less than Vth or -Vdd is less than -abs(Vth),Vth is assumed to be greater than 0 and less than Vdd in this example. It will be made clear in HW and in discussion,01/18/2022 16:35:14,01/18/2022 16:39:13
45,what is the value of Vth?,Some fixed value that is given in the class. In reality it is determined by fabrication and given to us once the device is made,01/18/2022 16:35:38,01/18/2022 16:40:11
46,"In the above equations it says Vthr >= 0,
so should it be: 0V <= Vthr?
what if Vthr = 0?",Typically this is never the case since Vth have values that are greater than 0. This value is determined during fabrication of the devices,01/18/2022 16:36:51,01/18/2022 16:39:46
47,Whats the difference between pmos and nmos?,nvm i figured it out!,01/18/2022 16:38:17,01/18/2022 16:40:32,"Nmos is on if gate voltage is greater than threhold voltage, whereas pmos is on if gate voltage is less than negative threshold",01/18/2022 16:38:17,01/18/2022 16:40:38,That is correct,01/18/2022 16:38:17,01/18/2022 16:41:50

49,If Vgs >= V thp then PMOS is on and if Vgs <= -V thn then NMOS is on; is this right?,,01/18/2022 16:40:30
50,Why would v_dd = v_out? I thought short circuits dont affect voltage?,"Since in this example PMOS is on and NMOS is off,  current from VDD flows through the switch and to Vout.",01/18/2022 16:40:51,01/18/2022 16:42:16,"That is correct. In other words, the short circuit guarantees Vout is Vdd since there is current flowing into Vout from Vdd",01/18/2022 16:40:51,01/18/2022 16:47:11
51,why is Vdd > Vthn?,*>= for NMOS in logic 1,01/18/2022 16:41:07,01/18/2022 16:41:43,live answered,01/18/2022 16:41:07,01/18/2022 16:42:09,That is usually an assumption made,01/18/2022 16:41:07,01/18/2022 16:42:27
52,How do we know that Vthp is less than Vdd?,This is a safe assumption to make and will be made clear,01/18/2022 16:41:11,01/18/2022 16:46:27
53,What’s the purpose of CMOS?,The biggest part is to build logic gates as you see in lecture and more in discussion next week,01/18/2022 16:41:23,01/18/2022 16:43:11
54,"In CMOS, is it always the case that PMOS is on top of NMOS?","No, CMOS is a general term for things that are built with NMOS and PMOS",01/18/2022 16:41:41,01/18/2022 16:42:51,"Just to reconfirm, does this mean that the current configuration of having PMOS on top of NMOS is to make an inversion? (creating a NOT gate)",01/18/2022 16:41:41,01/18/2022 16:45:26
55,Why did the 1 change to 0,The output is a 0 since the NMOS is connected so Vout is connected to ground when our input Vin is 1,01/18/2022 16:41:53,01/18/2022 16:43:32,Where did the zero come from,01/18/2022 16:41:53,01/18/2022 16:44:27
56,Could you explain again why Vout is 0?,,01/18/2022 16:41:55

58,Any reccomendations for the individuals who are totally lost rn?,Notes.,01/18/2022 16:42:25,01/18/2022 16:45:09,Read Note 1 and Discussion on monday will cover this more,01/18/2022 16:42:25,01/18/2022 16:45:20,So does the schedule on the website reflect what notes we should read? How far ahead should we be reading? Just want to make sure that I'm prepared for class :),01/18/2022 16:42:25,01/18/2022 16:47:28
59,Why do we need the PMOS if the NMOS output the opposite of vin in the CMOS?,"Because PMOS guarantees the output to be 0 by the switch not connecting. In the first example, the PMOS guarantees the output to be 1 by  beingg connected. The circuit is “inverting” the input value, which is why its called an inverter",01/18/2022 16:43:41,01/18/2022 16:45:02
60,What is the bar on top of “In” from “Out = In”,"It just means ""not In""",01/18/2022 16:44:25,01/18/2022 16:46:01,That is correct,01/18/2022 16:44:25,01/18/2022 16:46:14
61,whast is on the right side of the equal sign? Out = ?,"In with a line above it, ""not In""",01/18/2022 16:44:44,01/18/2022 16:45:25,That is correct,01/18/2022 16:44:44,01/18/2022 16:46:16
62,Can you do this same operation with just 1 NMOS transistor?,"No, you can try it out and see for yourself!",01/18/2022 16:44:45,01/18/2022 16:45:51
63,"Just to reconfirm, does this mean that the current configuration of having PMOS on top of NMOS is to make an inversion? (creating a NOT gate)",,01/18/2022 16:45:15
64,"in his notes it says that nmos is on when Vgs >= Vthn so if Vthn is 0, and Vin is 0, wouldn’t we be unable to ensure that the nmos gate is off?",Vthn is usually never 0,01/18/2022 16:45:15,01/18/2022 16:46:03
65,Is the input into this circuit performing the not always Vdd or 0V?,Typically yes,01/18/2022 16:47:16,01/18/2022 16:49:42
66,"when showing NAND and NOR, what do A and B represent, and what does the bar mean?","A and B just represent the input values. The bar means “NOT”, as in the logical operation “NOT”",01/18/2022 16:47:26,01/18/2022 16:47:59,Student’s answer is correct,01/18/2022 16:47:26,01/18/2022 16:49:23
67,"A and B are the two inputs provided into the NAND or NOR, the line means “NOT”",,01/18/2022 16:48:08
68,what is the operator for the exclusive or?,"If you're talking about the boolean algebra, it's usually a + with a circle around it",01/18/2022 16:48:27,01/18/2022 17:00:24
69,"Also, thank you Gavin and Vedang!",Your welcome!,01/18/2022 16:49:07,01/18/2022 16:49:33

71,Why is there a line on top of 0 V?,I’m not sure wheres the line?,01/18/2022 16:54:31,01/18/2022 16:58:19
72,What is the purpose of cascading?,In this example here theres no purpose. It is just an example. But our computers have millions of logic gates cascading together to perform complicated logic,01/18/2022 16:54:43,01/18/2022 16:58:01
73,"Can you please briefly explain the concept of ""not loading the previous state"" and when we would be concerned about potential loading?","Can you please briefly explain the concept of ""not loading the previous state"" and when we would be concerned about potential loading?",01/18/2022 16:54:49,01/18/2022 16:54:49,Loading occurs when you cascade different logic/circuits together. Not loading the previous state simply means you don’t want the new logic you want to connect affect the previous logic of your circuit. You will be concerned about loading any time you connect multiple types of circuit configurations together.,01/18/2022 16:54:49,01/18/2022 16:59:36
74,Can we conclude if we have even number of inverters we get vout = vin?,I mean -(-1) = 1 so yes.,01/18/2022 16:56:14,01/18/2022 17:00:52,Correct,01/18/2022 16:56:14,01/18/2022 17:01:07
75,What happens if you connect the output of the inverter back to its input?,,01/18/2022 16:58:56
76,how do the changes seem instantaneous?,Because it’s like flipping a switch.,01/18/2022 16:59:23,01/18/2022 17:00:26,"This is correct with the model for now. With the RC model though,  its not instantaneous (you will see why)",01/18/2022 16:59:23,01/18/2022 17:01:02
77,Will these lecture notes be uploaded to the 16B website?,Yes,01/18/2022 17:00:59,01/18/2022 17:01:14
