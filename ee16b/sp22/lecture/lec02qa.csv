50,Are we expected to know how to solve more forms of DE’s in this class or just the first-order DE’s?,"you don’t need to know anything in advance — the first order DEs are the most useful, but we will introduce some more diffeqs as the class goes on",01/20/2022 16:16:05,01/20/2022 16:16:55
51,Why do we assume that the original diff equation is an exponential function?,"because we recognize: hey this diffeq says x’ is proportional to x, exponential functions have x’ is proportional to x, why not just put in exponential",01/20/2022 16:16:13,01/20/2022 16:17:51

58,Can’t we also integrate dVx/Vx = -dt/RC to get the equation in yellow?,"it was mentioned already — separation of variables has some extra conditions that you need to show in order for it to work properly, otherwise it won’t find any/all of the solutions. in thsi case it works properly but we can’t know that for sure",01/20/2022 16:19:06,01/20/2022 16:20:13

73,shouldn’t y(0) be aX0 because y(t) = aX(t)?,if a = 1 then these are the same,01/20/2022 16:29:23,01/20/2022 16:30:22
74,could the line with * be explained again,live answered,01/20/2022 16:29:42,01/20/2022 16:31:33
75,how do we know y0 = x0,because we have the initial condition z(0) = x0 which is part of the diffeq (like the diffeq is an equation about z’ and also an equation about z(0)),01/20/2022 16:30:11,01/20/2022 16:31:05
76,why is d/dt y(t) = lambda y(t),live answered,01/20/2022 16:30:57,01/20/2022 16:31:13

78,sorry what’s the difference between xd and x?,x_d is a particular reference solution. we know its formula x_d(t) = x_0 e^(lambda t). x is just the variable we use in the diffeq,01/20/2022 16:31:49,01/20/2022 16:32:41
79,Is x(t) equal to xd(t)?,x(t) is just a function name we use when stating the diffeq,01/20/2022 16:32:27,01/20/2022 16:32:55
80,Why does this ratio equalling 1 prove uniqueness,"because this implies that x_d(t) = y(t) for all t, hence y = x_d",01/20/2022 16:32:46,01/20/2022 16:33:18
81,Don't we need to prove the uniqueness of the constant family of functions as solutions to dx/dt = 0?,"technically that is something we have to prove, yes — feel free to try it as an exercise :) but i think (differentiable + derivative 0 everywhere) <=> (constant) should be covered by calculus classes",01/20/2022 16:33:23,01/20/2022 16:35:05
82,Can we pick any type of initial condition? x(12) = x_12,or should it always be x(0) = x_0,01/20/2022 16:33:46,01/20/2022 16:34:32,you can pick any initial condition of that form. one thing you can do is make the change of variables z(t) = x(t - 12) and then you have a function z(0) = x_(12) and d/dt z(t) = lambda z(t) (by chain rule) which is a diffeq of the form we want,01/20/2022 16:33:46,01/20/2022 16:36:00

85,Are the invertors the NMOS transistors?,these are opamps,01/20/2022 16:35:38,01/20/2022 16:37:05,sorry they’re not — I was answering several questions at the same time and got a bit mixed up with my notes — sorry about that :(,01/20/2022 16:35:38,01/20/2022 16:41:09
86,in step (2) are we checking if a and b are unique or if our solution to Vx in general is unique? I'm confused how we got the derivative of y(t) = lambda * y(t),"not sure what you mean by step 2, but this equation: y’(t) = lambda y(t) is exactly the diffeq that y(t) must satisfy by assumption — since we say y(t) is solution to the diffeq",01/20/2022 16:35:56,01/20/2022 16:37:57,ohh is it because we already confirmed that Vx has to be in the form of ae^(bt)?,01/20/2022 16:35:56,01/20/2022 16:39:08,our proof with y was separate from the physical RC system.,01/20/2022 16:35:56,01/20/2022 16:41:51
87,How could we know the invertor also follow the rule of RC model?,"RC is just an approximation we use for reality; it’s not exact but it’s pretty close most of the time, so it’s generally empirically justified to use it",01/20/2022 16:38:02,01/20/2022 16:40:08
88,Are the inverse opamps CMOS transistors (since the professor replaced them)?,yes,01/20/2022 16:39:48,01/20/2022 16:41:26
89,Whats the difference between PMOS and NMOS?,"Coincidentally I made a list

NMOS:
- Vgs > Vtn == on (switch closed)
	- ie Vg >> Vs sufficiently.
- Vtn is a small positive treshold voltage.
- Charge carriers -> negative, electrons
- Source S is at bottom (makes CMOS easier to draw + related to physics of charge carriers)

PMOS:
- Vgs < - Vtp == on (switch closed)
	- ie Vg << Vs sufficiently 
- Vtn is a small negative treshold voltage.
- Note: Many use Vsg = -Vgs = Vs - Vg instread for PMOS.
- Charge carriers -> positive, ""holes""
- Source S is at top",01/20/2022 16:40:24,01/20/2022 16:41:08
90,I get why we can replace Vx with a capactiro but why can we add a Resistor in the the part of the circuit without a switch? Wouldn’t it affect Vout?,Perhaps.,01/20/2022 16:43:17,01/20/2022 16:44:12,i don’t see resistor without switch anywhere?,01/20/2022 16:43:17,01/20/2022 16:46:24,Oh sorry I’m assuming one of the two switches will end up closing and thus creating a wire. If that happened wouldnt Ron be inbetween VDD and Vx and thus affect Vx?,01/20/2022 16:43:17,01/20/2022 16:47:29
91,Where can we find class notes? (also the one from last lecture)?,16b website has relevant notes below each lecture topic,01/20/2022 16:43:17,01/20/2022 16:44:00,"I know, but I refer to class notes. Last lecture Ive been told in the Q&A that these will be poblished",01/20/2022 16:43:17,01/20/2022 16:45:07,Notes are posted right below the recording,01/20/2022 16:43:17,01/20/2022 16:46:13
92,Just to clarify we model PMOS and NMOS the same when doing circuit analysis,I think the source is supposed to have a different orientation when modeling them.,01/20/2022 16:46:23,01/20/2022 16:47:09,"yes. what is the gate/source/drain may be different for NMOS/PMOS (different orientation), but the way to connect gate/source and source/drain is the same for both NMOS and PMOS in RC model.",01/20/2022 16:46:23,01/20/2022 16:47:45
93,Why is the PMOS part on when Vin is 0?,VGS = some larger negative number (think -Vdd except for other elements),01/20/2022 16:49:24,01/20/2022 16:51:20
94,Isnt there a voltage drop across the resistor why is Vx still Vdd?,no current initially -> no voltage drop,01/20/2022 16:49:32,01/20/2022 16:51:45
95,Why does driving from a voltage source cause the capacitors to not affect the outcome/not matter?,Why does driving from a voltage source cause the capacitors to not affect the outcome/not matter?,01/20/2022 16:49:52,01/20/2022 16:49:52,"i think if you look at the notes there’s a derivation which doesn’t make this intuitive leap, and that makes a lot more sense to me personally",01/20/2022 16:49:52,01/20/2022 17:02:07
96,"What is the purpose of Vin, since it is blocked off by capacitors",it charges the capacitors depending on the configuration of NMOS/PMOS,01/20/2022 16:51:51,01/20/2022 16:54:43,"I think Vin isn't really *blocked off,* it still pushes the capacitors, dictating what voltage is across the gate. It's just not doing it directly through a simple wire",01/20/2022 16:51:51,01/20/2022 16:54:46
97,How do we know Vx = Vdd when t < 0,steady state analysis. in long term capacitors charge and get equal voltage to the source,01/20/2022 16:55:17,01/20/2022 16:55:54
98,why can we “ignore” the Vdd again,d/dt V_dd = 0 since V_dd is a constant,01/20/2022 16:58:44,01/20/2022 16:59:20,thank you!,01/20/2022 16:58:44,01/20/2022 16:59:47
99,where did tau come from,"we define tau (the time constant) as fulfilling the equation d/dt V_x(t) = -V_x(t) / tau, and this happens to be it",01/20/2022 16:59:51,01/20/2022 17:00:40
100,Why does the time constant equal this value,"we define tau (the time constant) as fulfilling the equation d/dt V_x(t) = -V_x(t) / tau, and this happens to be it",01/20/2022 16:59:51,01/20/2022 17:00:45
101,so the fact that vx(t) is exponential means that it will never really be 0?,yes,01/20/2022 17:01:27,01/20/2022 17:01:34
102,"Could we have solved this with charge sharing (16a style, charge preservation etc.) instead of Nodal analysis?",,01/20/2022 17:01:44
