   We guarantee 100% data durability. :ref:`REGULUS<regulus>` is able to retain your data
   even in natural and artificial disasters up to and including global
   thermonuclear war. However, data durability may be compromised in event of
   a second space race.

We provide two servers that you can utilize in the design of your client
application: the Keystore, and the Datastore.

The API for each can be found at the links below.
