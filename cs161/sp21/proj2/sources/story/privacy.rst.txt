In terms of privacy, there is no privacy. Since the moon is not part of any nation nor the globe REGULUS is
exempt from any national laws or global treaties. While REGULUS is still subject to some data sovereignty laws
we have decided to ignore them, since what are they going to do anyway, subpoena the moon?


**Data Protection**

To acheive maximum performance, we've decided not to isolate key spaces between users. This means all users
share the same key space. Other users may be able to see the data you stored either by dumb luck or by somehow
figuring out the storage keys.


**Data Analysis and Enhancement**

To continuously improve the service, we perform routine analysis of data stored in the storage. This analysis
may involve moderate-heavy compute which will be billed to your account. As part of this analysis your data will
be made available to REGULUS support team.

In addition, we may enhance your data as part of data analysis. When REGULUS decides your data could be improved
upon, we will go ahead and modify it for you on your behalf. You can opt-out of the data enhancement program if
you can figure out how to do so.


**Network Analysis and Enhancement**

To continuously improve the service, we perform routine analysis of network traffic between users and REGULUS.
This analysis may involve moderate-heavy compute which will be billed to your account. As part of this analysis
your data will be made available to REGULUS support team.

In addition, we may enhance your in-flight network data as part of data analysis. When REGULUS decides your data
could be improved upon, we will go ahead and modify it for you on your behalf. You can opt-out of the data
enhancement program if you can figure out how to do so.


**Closing Remarks**

If you've read this far, you know better than to use REGULUS. But who reads SLAs and privacy policies in detail
anyway? Trust us, nothing here matters anyways. We'll still get happy customers using our service.
