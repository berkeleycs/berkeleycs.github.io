[continued from Project 1]

Your satellite hacking adventures have convinced you that the Jupiter 
Orbiter project must be stopped...but how? Luckily for you, EvanBot has 
called on an expert for advice: CodaBot, an old friend of EvanBot and a 
CSA architect who previously worked on the `Venus impactor <https://venus.cs61c.org/>`_.

According to CodaBot, it should be possible to intercept the craft as it travels 
near Mars for a gravitational slingshot. CodaBot's intricate plan 
requires perfect coordination with your friends on Mars.

Unfortunately, there is only one communication channel between here on Earth and Mars, 
and it passes right through the watchful gaze of Caltopia.

:ref:`REGULUS<regulus>` is a one-of-a-kind cloud data storage service that uses CSA 
infrastructure. Because its datacenters are located on the lunar 
surface, REGULUS can be accessed by both Earthlings and Martians. In 
fact, due to atmospheric interference, the only way to send messages to 
Mars is by first storing them on REGULUS.

But be warned: there is nothing stopping Caltopia from reading data stored in REGULUS. 
The :ref:`privacy policy<regulusprivacy>` certainly seems a little suspicious to you. EvanBot points out that CSA 
may not take too kindly to reading about your plans to thwart their warship.

With no other way to talk with your Martian allies, you have no choice but 
to fly right under Caltopia's radar. You'll have to hide all your 
communication in plain sight, protecting your secret plans from any 
attempts to read or tamper with them. Every precaution should be taken 
to make sure the communication is safe from Caltopian signals 
intelligence. Only after you make sure Caltopia won't intercept the 
plans will CodaBot agree to send the details to Mars.

EvanBot and CodaBot are already in a concealed position deep within the Arctic 
Circle, ready to establish connection with REGULUS and Mars at your 
signal. The plans must be sent securely by Earth date April 9, when the 
Jupiter orbiter slingshots around Mars. The future of interplanetary peace depends on you.
