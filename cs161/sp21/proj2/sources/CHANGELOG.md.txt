# Changelog

This file is an **informative** list of the notable changes that have been made
to the Project 2 specification.

In other words, this document is just a useful resource to quickly skim an
*informal* explanation of changes made to various parts of the specification.
Nothing in this document should be interpreted as requirements and/or
clarifications on their own.

The text of the specification itself is the only **normative** documentation of
requirements and wording, so you must read the relevant sections of the
specification itself.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic
Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [2.4.2] - 2021-04-16
### Fixed
- Size of byte slice from HKDF is 64-bytes, not 16-bytes.

## [2.4.1] - 2021-04-09
### Changed
- Update wording in changelog entry for v2.4.0.
- State that the CHANGELOG is informative while spec text is normative.

## [2.4.0] - 2021-04-05
### Changed
- Made several updates to clarify the requirements related to sharing /
  receiving files:
  - Updated ``ShareFile()`` docs to clarify that the recipient is considered to
    have access to the file even if they choose not to use the secure file share
    invitation to receive the file into their personal file namespace.
  - Updated ``RevokeFile()`` docs to clarify that secure file share
    invitation(s) should be revoked even if the recipient has not yet called
    ``ReceiveFile()``.
  - Clarified wording of several requirements in the ``Sharing and Revoking``
    section. The requirements remain the same, but hopefully are more clear now.

- Removed brute force wording from the Keystore section of Threat Model and
  clarified that all actors are aware of the public key entries in the Keystore.

- Updated Threat Model to state that all rollback attacks, full and partial, are
  out of scope for the Datastore.

## [2.3.0] - 2021-04-03
### Changed
- Updated the spec to clarify the length requirements for the inputs/outputs of
  cryptographic functions.


## [2.2.0] - 2021-03-17
### Remove
- Updated requirement 3.6.3 to remove the need to treat as a no-operation (noop)
  the scenario in which a file is shared with a user who already has access. The
  requirement now states that behavior is undefined and will not be tested.

## [2.1.0] - 2021-03-16
### Changed
- Updated the Malicious Users section of Threat Model to clarify that any user
  can record information and that users will only become malicious after they
  are revoked.

- Updated requirement 3.5.7 to clarify that files do not have versions.

### Added
- Added requirement 3.7.2 to clarify that the only efficiency requirements are
  for the AppendFile() function.

- Added requirement 3.7.8 that some information can be leaked.

### Removed
- Removed bullet in requirement 3.6.1 that said users could delete files.

### Fixed
- Fixed code examples in docs for Hash-Based Key Derivation Function (HKDF).

## [2.0.0] - 2021-03-15
### Added
- Updated 3.6.4 to change the revoke requirement so that now the client only
  needs to allow the file owner to revoke from users with whom they have
  directly shared the file.

- Added the fun story background to the project spec! ðŸ˜Ž

- Added link to Gradescope submission for the `Design Document - Draft`
  deliverable.

## [2.0.0] - 2021-03-10

### Changed

- Updated requirement 3.8.1 and ReceiveFile() docs to clarify that accessTokens
  are pointers to share invitations and the invitation is what must be
  protected.

### Added

- Added bullet to requirement 3.6.1 to explicitly state that users can read the
  contents of shared files.

## [2.0.0] - 2021-03-10
### Changed
- Updated requirement 3.1.1.1 to say that clients SHOULD assume that usernames
  are unique, instead of MAY assume.

- Updated requirement 3.5.1 to clarify that "the client design MAY NOT leak the
  length of any filename".

- Clarified requirement 3.2.3 that client DOES NOT need to support concurrency.

- Updated User Communications section of Threat Model to clarify that the
  insecure chat app is only used for sending accessTokens.

### Fixed

- Fixed broken link in Access Tokens section of Design Requirements.
- Updated StoreFile() docs to indicate that the function can return an error.

## [2.0.0] - 2021-03-09
### Changed
