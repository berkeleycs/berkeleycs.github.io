   Data stored in :ref:`REGULUS<regulus>` is well airgapped with 385,000 km of vaccum. As a side effect, 
   REGULUS is extremely well guarded against fires due to lack of oxygen in its premises.
   Any fires that do break out will be extinguished in 12 hours when REGULUS is no longer
   exposed to sunlight and temperature drops to below freezing.
