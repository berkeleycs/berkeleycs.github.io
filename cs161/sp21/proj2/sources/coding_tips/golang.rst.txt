Common Issues With Go
=====================

#. **How to append a byte to a slice without the bytes library**

   The following will return a new slice with the second argument appended to
   the first argument.

   .. code-block:: go

     append({byte slice}, byte({a number}))

#. **How do we simulate "corruption" in our tests, without assuming anything
   about the staff's implementation?**

   ``DatastoreGetMap()`` might be helpful. You can compare the entries in
   Datastore before/after calling an API function (StoreFile, AppendFile, etc),
   and use the difference to deduce where things are stored.
