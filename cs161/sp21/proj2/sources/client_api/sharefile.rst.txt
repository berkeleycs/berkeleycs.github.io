User.ShareFile: Create a secure file share invitation
=====================================================

.. function:: ShareFile(filename string, recipient string) (accessToken UUID, err error)

  Shares the given file with the given recipient by creating a secure file share
  invitation that immediately grants the recipient permission to access the
  given file and take the actions detailed in
  :ref:`requirement_sharing_and_revoking` #1.

  The recipient is considered to have access to the file even if they choose not
  to use the secure file share invitation to receive the file into their
  personal file namespace.

  The returned accessToken must be the UUID storage key at which the secure
  file share invitation is stored in the :doc:`/servers/datastore`.

  You may assume this function will only be called in a way that creates a valid
  sharing tree (see :ref:`requirement_sharing_and_revoking`).

  Returns an error if:

    - the given file does not exist in the caller's personal file namespace; or

    - sharing cannot complete due to any malicious action.

  :param filename: The name of the file to share with the recipient.
  :type filename: string
  :param recipient: The username of the user with whom the file should be
                    shared.
  :type data: string

  :rtype: UUID, error

.. warning::
    Do not forget that your design must satisfy **all** requirements, including:

    #. All :ref:`requirement_access_tokens` requirements.

    #. All :ref:`requirement_sharing_and_revoking` requirements.
