Client Application API
======================

.. note::
  **Staff Advice:** Design a solution before starting the implementation.
  Students consistently agree that design is harder than implementation across
  multiple iterations of this project. A faithful implementation of a faulty
  design will not earn you many points.

  See additional suggestions in :ref:`staff_advice`.

The API for each of the 8 functions that you are required to implement in
`proj2.go`_ are documented in the following pages.

    inituser

    loadfile
    appendfile
    sharefile
