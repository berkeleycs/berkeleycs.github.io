   :ref:`REGULUS<regulus>` guarantees availability when line of sight can be established
   between you and the moon. Requests to REGULUS may be processed when 
   line of sight is unavailable depending on the availability of uplink 
   proxies around the globe and conditions of the ionosphere.

   We guarantee 0-60% uptime depending on the time of month, cloud cover 
   and occurance of solar flares.
