Test Coverage
=============

You must write tests for your client application in `proj2_test.go`_. Your tests
should verify correct functionality of the client, correct handling of erroneous
inputs, and any security problems. Each test should be defined in a separate
function.

Several basic functionality tests are already defined in `proj2_test.go`_. Make
sure that your implementation **does not** panic on these basic functionality
tests. An implementation that panics on those tests will receive **zero credit**
for the testing portion of the :doc:`total grade </grading/index>`.

To test your code, run the following command in your terminal at the root of the
checked out `Project 2 - Starter Code
<https://github.com/cs161-staff/project2-starter-code>`_ repository: ``go test
-v``.

Part of your testing score is determined by code coverage (the amount of the
program that is exercised in your tests). Your tests will be run against the
staff implementation of the client application. Many lines in the staff
implementation are instrumented so that its execution will be a point towards
your test score. A comprehensive test suite will have better coverage and will
increase your score.

You can check your test score by submitting to the autograder on Gradescope
at any time before the project deadline.
