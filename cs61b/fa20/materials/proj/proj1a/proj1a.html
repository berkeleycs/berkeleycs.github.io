<p>This project is in two parts. Part 1A will be due 09/14, and Part 1B will be due
09/18.</p>

<p>Rather than simulating the glorious gravitational physics of our universe,
we’ll instead be building data structures. Not the most glamorous thing, but
this will provide you with plenty of opportunities to practice everything we’ve
been doing in lecture before our midterm rolls around.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>In project 1A, we will build implementations of a “Double Ended Queue” using
both lists and arrays. In project 1B, we will learn how to write
our own tests for those data structures, and will use the Double Ended Queue to
solve some small real world probelms.</p>

<p>In this part of the project you will create two Java files:
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LinkedListDeque.java</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ArrayDeque.java</code>, with public methods listed
below.</p>

<p>Unlike Project 0, we will provide relatively little scaffolding. In other
words, we’ll say what you should do, but not how.</p>

<p>For this project, you must work alone! Please carefully read the <a href="../../../about.html#project-collaboration-policy">Policy on
Collaboration and Cheating</a> to see what
this means exactly.</p>

<p><strong>We strongly encourage you to switch to IntelliJ for this project.</strong> While it’s not absolutely required, you will have a better time. The ability to visually debug your code can be incredibly useful, it’s also nice to have a development environment that catches syntax errors as you are typing, and it avoids the need to type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">javac</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">java</code> (or pressing arrow keys) a bajillion times. If you need a refresher on how to import a project, you can follow the <a href="http://fa20.datastructur.es/materials/lab/lab2setup/lab2setup#project-setup">Intellij setup guide</a></p>

<p>Additionally, <strong>we will be enforcing style</strong>. You must follow the <a href="https://fa20.datastructur.es/materials/guides/style-guide.html">style guide</a> or you will lose points on the autograder.</p>

<h2 id="getting-the-skeleton-files">Getting the Skeleton Files</h2>

<p>As with Project 0, you should start by downloading the skeleton files.</p>

<p>To do this, head to the folder containing your copy of your repository. For
example, if your login is ‘s101’, then head to the ‘fa20-s101’ folder (or any
subdirectory).</p>

<p>To make sure you have the latest copy of the skeleton files, use
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git pull skeleton master</code>. If you’re using a newer version of git, you
might need to run
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git pull skeleton master -allow-unrelated-histories</code>.</p>

<p>You should now see a proj1a directory appear with
files that match <a href="https://github.com/Berkeley-CS61B/skeleton-fa20/tree/master/proj1a">the skeleton
repository</a>.</p>

<p>If you get some sort of error, STOP and either figure it out by carefully
reading the git guide or seek help at OH or Ed. You’ll potentially save
yourself a lot of trouble vs. guess-and-check with git commands. If you find
yourself trying to use commands recommended by Google like 
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">force push</code>,
<a href="https://twitter.com/heathercmiller/status/526770571728531456">don’t</a>. <strong>Don’t
use force push, even if a post you found on Stack Overflow says to do it!</strong></p>

<p>The only provided file in the skeleton is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LinkedListDequeTest.java</code>. This file
provides examples of how you might write tests to verify the correctness of
your code. We strongly encourage you try out the given tests, as well as to
write at least one of your own.</p>

<p>You may find writing tests quite annoying. However, in
part B of this project, we will use a library called JUnit, which will make
writing tests much easier and organized. We will talk more about testing in a
later section.</p>

<h2 id="the-deque-api">The Deque API</h2>

<p>The double ended queue is very similar to the SLList and AList classes that
we’ve discussed in class. Here is a definition from
<a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/deque/deque/">cplusplus.com</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Deque (usually pronounced like “deck”) is an irregular acronym of double-ended
queue. Double-ended queues are sequence containers with dynamic sizes that can
be expanded or contracted on both ends (either its front or its back).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Specifically, any deque implementation must have exactly the following
operations:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">public void addFirst(T item)</code>: Adds an item of type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T</code> to the front of the
deque.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">public void addLast(T item)</code>: Adds an item of type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T</code> to the back of the
deque.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">public boolean isEmpty()</code>: Returns true if deque is empty, false otherwise.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">public int size()</code>: Returns the number of items in the deque.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">public void printDeque()</code>: Prints the items in the deque from first to last,
separated by a space. Once all the items have been printed, print out a new line.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">public T removeFirst()</code>: Removes and returns the item at the front of the
deque. If no such item exists, returns null.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">public T removeLast()</code>: Removes and returns the item at the back of the
deque. If no such item exists, returns null.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">public T get(int index)</code>: Gets the item at the given index, where 0 is the
front, 1 is the next item, and so forth. If no such item exists, returns null.
Must not alter the deque!</li>
</ul>

<p>Your class should accept any generic type (not just integers). For information
on creating and using generic data structures, see <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19TTe3JgFscc4RLwokvQ_gOM72DSrfs9Y6ZST_fv3aQ4">lecture
5</a>.
Make sure to pay close attention to the rules of thumb on the last slide about
generics.</p>

<p>In this project, you will provide two implementations for the Deque interface: one powered by a Linked List, and one by a resizing array.</p>

<h2 id="project-tasks">Project Tasks</h2>

<h3 id="1-linked-list-deque">1. Linked List Deque</h3>

<p><em>Note: We covered everything needed in lecture to do this part in Lectures 4
and 5 (9/2 and 9/4).</em></p>

<p>Create a file called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LinkedListDeque.java</code> in your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">proj1a</code> directory.</p>

<p>As your first deque implementation, you’ll build the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LinkedListDeque</code> class,
which will be linked list based.</p>

<p>Your operations are subject to the following rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">add</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">remove</code> operations must not involve any looping or recursion. A
single such operation must take “constant time”, i.e. execution time should not
depend on the size of the deque. This means that you cannot use loops that go over all/most elements of the deque.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">get</code> must use iteration, not recursion.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">size</code> must take constant time.</li>
  <li>Do not maintain references to items that are
no longer in the deque. The amount of memory that your program uses at any given time must be
proportional to the number of items. For example, if you add 10,000 items to
the deque, and then remove 9,999 items, the resulting memory usage should amount to
a deque with 1 item, and not 10,000.</li>
</ul>

<p>Implement all the methods listed above in “The Deque API” section.</p>

<p>In addition, you also need to implement:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">public LinkedListDeque()</code>: Creates an empty linked list deque.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">public T getRecursive(int index)</code>: Same as get, but uses recursion.</li>
</ul>

<p>You may add any private helper classes or methods in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LinkedListDeque.java</code> if
you deem it necessary.</p>

<p>While this may sound simple, there are many design issues to consider, and you
may find the implementation more challenging than you’d expect. Make sure to
consult the lecture on doubly linked lists, particularly the slides on sentinel
nodes: <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1suIeJ1SIGxoNDT8enLwsSrMxcw4JTvJBsMcdARpqQCk/pub?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000&amp;slide=id.g829fe3f43_0_291">two sentinel
topology</a>,
and <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1suIeJ1SIGxoNDT8enLwsSrMxcw4JTvJBsMcdARpqQCk/pub?start=false&amp;loop=false&amp;delayms=3000&amp;slide=id.g829fe3f43_0_376">circular sentinel
topology</a>.
I prefer the circular approach. <strong>You are not allowed to use Java’s built in
LinkedList data structure (or any data structure from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">java.util.*</code>) in your
implementation</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="2-array-deque">2. Array Deque</h3>

<p><em>Note: We’ll have covered everything needed in lecture to do this part by lecture 6 (9/7).</em></p>

<p>Create a file called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ArrayDeque.java</code> in your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">proj1a</code> directory.</p>

<p>As your second deque implementation, you’ll build the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ArrayDeque</code> class. This
deque must use arrays as the core data structure.</p>

<p>For this implementation, your operations are subject to the following rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">add</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">remove</code> must take constant time, except during resizing
operations.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">get</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">size</code> must take constant time.</li>
  <li>The starting size of your array should be 8.</li>
  <li>The amount of memory that your program uses at any given time must be
proportional to the number of items. For example, if you add 10,000 items to
the deque, and then remove 9,999 items, you shouldn’t still be using an array
of length 10,000ish. For arrays of length 16 or more, your usage factor should
always be at least 25%. This means that before performing a remove operation that will bring the number of elements in the array under 25% the length of the array, you should resize the size of the array down. For smaller arrays, your usage factor can be
arbitrarily low.</li>
</ul>

<p>Implement all the methods listed above in “The Deque API” section.</p>

<p>In addition, you also need to implement:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">public ArrayDeque()</code>: Creates an empty array deque.</li>
</ul>

<p>You may add any private helper classes or methods in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ArrayDeque.java</code> if you
deem it necessary.</p>

<p>You will need to somehow keep track of what array indices hold the Deque’s front and back elements. We <em>strongly recommend</em> that you treat your array as circular for this
exercise. In other words, if your front item is at position zero, and you
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">addFirst</code>, the new front should loop back around to the end of the array
(so the new front item in the deque will be the last item in the underlying
array). This will result in far fewer headaches than non-circular approaches.
See the <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XBJOht0xWz1tEvLuvOL4lOIaY0NSfArXAvqgkrx0zpc/edit#slide=id.g1094ff4355_0_450">project 1 demo
slides</a>
for more details.</p>

<p>Correctly resizing your array is <strong>very tricky</strong>, and will require some deep thought. Try drawing out various approaches by hand. It may take you quite some time to come up with the right approach, and we encourage you to debate the big ideas with your fellow students or TAs. Make sure that your actual implementation <strong>is by you alone</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h4 id="q-how-should-i-print-the-items-in-my-deque-when-i-dont-know-their-type">Q: How should I print the items in my deque when I don’t know their type?</h4>

<p>A: It’s fine to use the default String that will be printed (this string comes
from an Object’s implementation of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">toString()</code>, which we’ll talk more about
later this semester).  For example, if you called the generic type in your
class <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Jumanji</code>, to print <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Jumanji j</code>, you can call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">System.out.print(j)</code>.</p>

<h4 id="q-i-cant-get-java-to-create-an-array-of-generic-objects">Q: I can’t get Java to create an array of generic objects!</h4>

<p>A: Use the strange syntax we saw in lecture,
i.e. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T[] a = (T[]) new Object[1000];</code>. Here, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">T</code> is a generic type, it’s a placeholder for other
Object types like “String” or “Integer”.</p>

<h4 id="q-i-tried-that-but-im-getting-a-compiler-warning">Q: I tried that but I’m getting a compiler warning?</h4>

<p>A: Sorry, this is something the designers of Java messed up when they introduced
generics into Java. There’s no nice way around it. Enjoy your compiler warning.
We’ll talk more about this in a few weeks.</p>

<h4 id="q-how-do-i-make-my-arrows-point-to-particular-fields-of-a-data-structure">Q: How do I make my arrows point to particular fields of a data structure?</h4>
<p>In your diagram from lecture it looked like the arrows were able to point to the
middle of an array or at specific fields of a node.</p>

<p>A: Any time I drew an arrow in class that pointed at an object, the pointer was to
the ENTIRE object, not a particular field of an object. In fact it is
impossible for a reference to point to the fields of an object in Java.</p>

<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>
<p>Testing is an important part of code writing in industry and academia. It is an
essential skill that can prevent monetary loss and hazardous bugs in industry,
or in your case, losing points. Learning how to write good, comprehensive unit
tests, and developing a good habit of always testing code before shipping are
some core objectives of CS 61B.</p>

<p>We will focus more on testing in the next part of this project, project 1B. For
now, we have provided you a very simple sanity check,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LinkedListDequeTest.java</code>. To use the sample testing file, you must uncomment
the lines in the sample tests. Only uncomment a test once you have implemented
all of the methods used by that test (otherwise it won’t compile). Execute the
main method to run the tests. When testing your project, <strong>remember you can use
the visualizer from inside IntelliJ!</strong></p>

<p>You will not submit <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LinkedListDequeTest.java</code>. It is for your benefit to write
more comprehensive tests for both <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LinkedListDeque</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ArrayDeque</code> before
submitting. Note, passing the given tests in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LinkedListDequeTest.java</code> does
<em>not necessarily</em> mean that you will pass all of the autograder tests or
receive full credit.</p>

<h2 id="tips">Tips</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Check out the <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XBJOht0xWz1tEvLuvOL4lOIaY0NSfArXAvqgkrx0zpc/edit#slide=id.g1094ff4355_0_450">project 1
slides</a>
for some additional visually oriented tips.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you’re stuck and don’t even know where to start: One great first step is
implementing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SLList</code> and/or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AList</code>. For maximum efficiency, work with a friend 
or two or three.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Take things a little at a time. Writing tons of code all at once is going to
lead to misery and only misery. If you wrote too much stuff and feel
overwhelmed, comment out whatever is unnecessary.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If your first try goes badly, don’t be afraid to scrap your code and start
over. The amount of code for each class isn’t actually that much (my solution
is about 130 lines for each .java file, including all comments and
whitespace).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ArrayDeque</code>, consider not doing resizing at all until you know your code
works without it. Resizing is a performance optimization (and is required for
full credit).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Work out what your data structures will look like on paper before you try
implementing them in code! If you can find a willing friend, have them give
commands, while you attempt to draw everything out. Try to come up with
operations that might reveal problems with your implementation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make sure you think carefully about what happens if the data structure goes
from empty, to some non-zero size (e.g. 4 items) back down to zero again, and
then back to some non-zero size. This is a common oversight.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sentinel nodes make life <strong>much</strong> easier, once you understand them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Circular data structures may take a little while to understand, but make life much easier for both implementations (but
especially the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ArrayDeque</code>).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consider a helper function to do little tasks like compute array indices. For
example, in my implementation of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ArrayDeque</code>, I wrote a function called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">int
minusOne(int index)</code> that computed the index immediately “before” a given
index.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Consider using the Java Visualizer (which you installed in lab2setup) to visualize 
your Deque as you step through with the debugger. The visualizer is an icon of a blue 
coffee cup with an eye, and is the tab next to the “Console” tab in the debugger 
panel). See the <a href="https://fa20.datastructur.es/materials/guides/plugin.html#using-the-plugin">CS 61B plugin guide</a>
if you can’t figure out how to get the visualizer to show. The visualizer will look something like this: <img src="java_visualizer.png" alt="java_visualizer" /></p>
