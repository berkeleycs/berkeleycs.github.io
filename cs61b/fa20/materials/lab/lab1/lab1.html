<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before You Begin</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Before beginning this lab, complete
  <a href="https://fa20.datastructur.es/materials/lab/lab1setup/lab1setup">lab1setup</a> to install software required for 61B.</li>
  <li>Be aware that there are a large number of setup steps this first week.
  <strong>Don’t be discouraged</strong>, and make sure to ask for help if you’re stuck! 
<!--* Project 0 will allow pair-partnerships subject to [these
  rules](../../guides/partnerships). Lab might be a good place to meet a
  partner -- but make sure you both have the same Java background and are
  willing to work together in the same room (see partnership rules for
  details)! We will also have a thread on Ed Discussion to help you find partners.--></li>
  <li>
    <p class="redtext">For those of you who have been working ahead, do not use
  IntelliJ  (from Lab 2) today. For today's lab, please work from the command
  line to compile and run your code.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Warning: This lab runs a little long, and it’s normal if you do not finish during your lab period, especially if you end up having a tricky setup issue that requires a lot of assistance.</li>
  <li>It’s OK to talk to other students while you work on this lab (or any other), but you should ultimately do all the typing/programming/entering-of-commands yourself. There’s a lot of important setup information in this lab that you need to have done independently of anyone else.</li>
</ul>

<!--
## Lab Goals

In this lab, you'll:
1. Learn how to set up your GitHub repository.
1. Learn how to compile files from the command line.
1. Complete a short programming problem (HelloNumbers.java).
1. Learn some basic commands for the Git version control software. 
1. Demonstrate your knowledge of these basic Git commands using a checkoff.
1. Learn how to get the starter files for assignments in 61B using Git.
1. Complete another short programming problem (LeapYear.java).
1. Learn how to submit your work for autograding on Gradescope.
-->

<!-- #### Find A Partner ####

Recal

Introduce yourself to someone you don't know who has the same operating system to collaborate with you as you complete the setup steps for today's lab. Try to find someone who has similar programming experience -- you're encouraged to partner up for Project 0!
-->

<h2 id="github-and-beacon">GitHub and Beacon</h2>

<p>Instead of bCourses, CS61B uses an in-house system for centralizing your grades and student information called Beacon.</p>

<p>In this section, we’ll set up your Beacon account as well as your CS 61B GitHub repository (“repo”), which you will need to submit all coding assignments.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create an account at <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub.com</a>. If you already have an account, you do not need to create a new one.</li>
  <li>Go to <a href="https://fa20.beacon.datastructur.es/register/">the Beacon website</a> and you’ll be guided through a few steps to complete your GitHub repository registration. Please follow them carefully! You must be logged in to your Berkeley account to complete the Google Form quiz. If any errors occur while you’re working through the steps, please let your TA know immediately.</li>
  <li>After completing all of the steps, you should receive an email inviting you to collaborate on your course GitHub repository, accept the email invitation and you should be good to go. Hooray! <strong>Don’t follow the instructions that GitHub says you might want to do</strong> – instead, follow the instructions given later in this lab.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="more-details-about-your-repository">More details about your repository</h3>
<p>Your repository will have a name containing a number that is unique to you! For instance, if your repo is called “fa20-s42”, you’ll be able to visit your private repository at https://github.com/Berkeley-CS61B-Student/fa20-s42 (when logged into GitHub).</p>

<p>Additionally, the instructors, TAs, and tutors will be able to view your repository. This means you can (and should!) link to your code when asking private debugging questions on Ed. No other students will be able to view your repository. As a reminder, you may not post code from this course publicly, even after completing the course. Doing so is a violation of our course policies and you might be subject to disciplinary action.</p>

<p>When you work with your lab partner, you’ll also receive a separate shared repository that you should use for labs. More details will be provided later.</p>

<p>Additionally, after registering with Beacon, you will be invited to collaborate on another repo of the form “snaps-fa20-sXXX” - don’t worry about what this repo is for now, just accept the invitation so you have access to it. We will have more information about these “snaps” repositories in lab2!</p>

<h2 id="a-java-compilation--development">A. Java Compilation &amp; Development</h2>
<p>Before proceeding, make sure you’ve installed Java on your computer as described in the lab 1 setup linked above.</p>

<h4 id="introduction-to-java">Introduction to Java</h4>

<p>Complete exercises 1.1.1 and 1.1.2 from the <a href="https://joshhug.gitbooks.io/hug61b/content/chap1/chap11.html">Hug61B
textbook</a>. Also consider reading Chapter 1.1 as a review of what you’ve already seen in lecture. Note that the videos embedded in the textbook are just the lecture videos, so there’s no need to watch them again. When you’re done, you should have a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HelloWorld.java</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HelloNumbers.java</code> file.</p>

<p>For this lab, you should use the command line,
not an IDE like IntelliJ or Eclipse (see Lab 2). Don’t worry about submitting
your work yet, we’ll cover how to do that later in this lab.</p>

<h2 id="b-git--local-repos">B. Git &amp; Local Repos</h2>

<p>In 61B, you’ll be required to use the Git version control system, which is wildly
popular out in the real world. Unfortunately, the abstractions behind it are
fairly tricky to understand, so it is likely that you will encounter significant
frustration at some point as you learn to use Git.</p>

<p>Before you proceed, read sections A-C of Sarah Kim’s <a href="../../guides/using-git.html">Using Git
Guide</a></p>

<div class="redtext">STOP! Do not proceed until you have read sections A
through C of the Using Git Guide.</div>
<p>You do not need to read section D or later.</p>

<h2 id="c-git-exercise">C. Git Exercise</h2>

<p>Now that you’ve read the first 3 sections of the Using Git Guide, you’re now ready to
start using Git! <!--As part of your lab checkoff, you will be working through a
small Git workflow by setting up a Git repository and making a couple commits
to the repository. An academic intern or TA will look at the Git repository during
checkoff to ensure that it is in a good state.--> 
If you’re stuck on a step at any point, don’t hesitate to ask a TA or an 
academic intern for help!</p>

<p>If you need help with creating directories, creating files, changing
directories, etc., see section B of <a href="https://fa20.datastructur.es/materials/lab/lab1setup/lab1setup.html">lab1setup</a>.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>First, tell Git your name and email address so that your commits are correctly
attributed to you. Run the following commands:</p>

    <p>Replace “Your Name” with your name, and “you@berkeley.edu” with your email address.
You should use the email address that you used to sign up for GitHub with.
If that’s not your “@berkeley.edu” email address, that’s okay.</p>

    <div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> <span class="nv">$ </span>git config <span class="nt">--global</span> user.email <span class="s2">"you@berkeley.edu"</span>
 <span class="nv">$ </span>git config <span class="nt">--global</span> user.name <span class="s2">"Your Name"</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Create a directory called lab1-exercise.</strong> You should put this folder
on your desktop.</li>
  <li>Move into the lab1-exercise directory using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code> command, and initialize a Git repository in
 this directory. <strong>Make sure you are in the lab1-exercise folder before initializing the repository.</strong>.</li>
  <li>Create a file called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">61b.txt</code> in any way you’d like. In this .txt file, add
 the text “61b version 1” into it.</li>
  <li>Create another file called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">61c.txt</code> in any way you’d like. In this .txt
 file, add the text “61c version 1” into it.</li>
  <li>Begin tracking only <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">61b.txt</code>, and create a new commit containing just this
 file, with the following commit message: “Add 61b.txt”.</li>
  <li>Make a modification in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">61b.txt</code> by changing the text in the file to:
 “61b changed to version 2”.</li>
  <li>Make another commit, this time containing both <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">61b.txt</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">61c.txt</code>. The
 commit message should be: “Update 61b.txt and add 61c.txt”.</li>
  <li>Finally, make one more modification to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">61b.txt</code> by changing the text in the
 file to: “61b changed to version 3”. Don’t commit this version.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Type in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git status</code>, and you shuold see something similar to below:</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>/lab1-exercise $ git status
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
    (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
    (use "git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)

    modified:   61b.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now try <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git log</code>, and you should see something like:</p>

    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>/lab1-exercise $ git log
commit 273f3c4ed84df2c8f8accd1b807b9f3744779e95 (HEAD -&gt; master)

    Add 61b.txt
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git checkout</code> command to revert your 61b.txt back to the original commit, i.e. the one where 61b.txt says “61b version 1”. Note: Be careful when using the <em>checkout</em> command, as your repo might end up
in an unexpected state. Specifically, if you see something about
your repository being in a detached HEAD state as a result of a checkout
command, that is something we don’t want. Read
<a href="https://fa20.datastructur.es/materials/guides/git-wtfs.html#head-detached-at--">here</a> for more on what it is
and how to fix it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Verify that your checkout command from the previous step actually caused the 61b.txt to be reverted.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Perform <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git add 61b.txt</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git commit</code> with a message that says something like “revert 61B back to its original form.”</li>
</ol>

<!--
Be sure to save this repository and directory until you get checked-off by an
academic intern or TA. See section E for more information on getting credit for
the lab checkoff. **Along with other short conceptual questions involving
Git, you will be asked to revert 61b.txt back to the version in the most recent
commit, as well as back to the earliest version of the file, so make sure
you know how to do this!** Hint: Look into the *checkout* command.-->

<h2 id="d-git--remote-repos">D. Git &amp; Remote Repos</h2>

<p>We’re now ready to finish off the lab. But first…</p>

<p class="redtext">STOP! Before you proceed, read section D of the Using Git Guide</p>
<p><a href="../../guides/using-git.html#d-remote-repositories">Here</a> is the link to the guide. There is no need
to read sections E or later. Those are for your later reference, and do not
need to be read during this lab.</p>

<p>In 61B, you’ll be required to submit your code to your personal GitHub
repository. This is for several reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To spare you the incredible agony of losing your files.</li>
  <li>To provide frequent checkpoints of your work so that you can go back to an earlier version if you find you’ve somehow broken your code.</li>
  <li>To submit your work for grading and to get results back from the autograder.</li>
  <li>To ensure that we have easy access to your code so that we can help if you’re
  stuck.</li>
  <li><strong>To dissuade you from posting your solutions on the web in a public GitHub
  repository</strong>. This is a major violation of course policy!</li>
  <li>To expose you to a realistic workflow that is common on every major project
  you’ll ever work on again.</li>
  <li>To enable safer, more equitable partner collaborations.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you use multiple computers in this course, you’ll need to repeat the steps below on every computer that you use.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Clone your <a href="https://github.com/Berkeley-CS61B-Student">Berkeley-CS61B-Student
organization</a> repository.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Navigate to the spot in your folders on your computer where you’d like to
 start your repository. In the example below, I’m assuming you want all your stuff in a folder named cs61b, but you can pick a different name if you’d like.
        <div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp"> $</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">cd </span>cs61b
</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </li>
      <li>Enter the following command to clone your GitHub repo. Make sure to
 replace the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">s**</code> with the class id you were given when you registered for your repo.
        <div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp"> $</span><span class="w"> </span>git clone https://github.com/Berkeley-CS61B-Student/fa20-s<span class="k">**</span>.git
</code></pre></div>        </div>
        <p>If you’d like to use SSH instead of HTTPS (and <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/">set up your own SSH
 key</a>), feel free
 to also do that instead. If you don’t know what any of this means, just use the command above.
 The advantage of SSH is that you won’t have to type in
 your GitHub password every time you use your repository.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Move into your newly created repo! (Make sure you do this part, or the
 rest of the steps below will not work correctly.)
        <div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp"> $</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">cd </span>fa20-s<span class="k">**</span>
</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Add the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">skeleton</code> remote repository. You will pull from this remote
repository to get starter code for assignments. (Make sure that you are
within the newly created repository folder when the continue with these
commands.)</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Enter the following command to add the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">skeleton</code> remote.
        <div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp"> $</span><span class="w"> </span>git remote add skeleton https://github.com/Berkeley-CS61B/skeleton-fa20.git
</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </li>
      <li>Listing the remotes should now show both the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">origin</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">skeleton</code>
 remotes.
        <div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp"> $</span><span class="w"> </span>git remote <span class="nt">-v</span>
</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </li>
      <li>If you get an error that says “Not a git repository”, make sure you’re in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fa20-s**</code> directory.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="working-on-the-skeleton">Working on the Skeleton</h4>

<ol>
  <li>You must now pull from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">skeleton</code> remote in order to get the starter code
for Lab 1. You will also do this when new projects and assignments are
released. To do this, use the spookiest command in the whole git toolbox:
    <div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp"> $</span><span class="w"> </span>git pull skeleton master
</code></pre></div>    </div>
    <p>What this does is grab all remote files from the repo named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">skeleton</code>
 (which is located at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https://github.com/Berkeley-CS61B/skeleton-fa20.git</code>)
 and copies them into your current folder.</p>

    <p>If you get an error similar to “fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories”, you probably ran
 GitHub’s suggested commands when you created your repository. To fix this, you can instead run:</p>
    <div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp"> $</span><span class="w"> </span>git pull <span class="nt">--rebase</span> <span class="nt">--allow-unrelated-histories</span> skeleton master
</code></pre></div>    </div>
    <p>this time only.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you list the files in your current directory, you’ll see that there are now many folders including one named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lab1</code> Look in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lab1</code> folder and you’ll see a file called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LeapYear.java</code>  that you’ll work with in later parts of this lab.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Move the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HelloWorld.java</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HelloNumbers.java</code> that you previously
created into the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lab1</code> directory. If you didn’t create <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HelloNumbers.java</code>,
go back and do Exercise 1.1.2 (see part A of this lab).</p>
  </li>
  <li>Stage and commit <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HelloWorld.java</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HelloNumbers.java</code>.
    <div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp"> $</span><span class="w"> </span>git add lab1/<span class="k">*</span>
<span class="gp"> $</span><span class="w"> </span>git commit <span class="nt">-m</span> <span class="s2">"completed first part of lab1"</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>Push these changes to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">master</code> branch on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">origin</code> remote repo.
    <div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp"> $</span><span class="w"> </span>git push origin master
</code></pre></div>    </div>
    <p>You can verify that this has been successful by viewing your repo on
 <a href="https://github.com">github.com</a>. For example, if your repo were <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fa20-s42</code>, you’d go to <a href="https://github.com/Berkeley-CS61B-Student/fa20-s42">https://github.com/Berkeley-CS61B-Student/fa20-s42</a>.</p>

    <p>If you get an error similar to “Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind its remote counterpart”,
 and you had to use the “–allow-unrelated-histories” flag in the first step, add the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-f</code> (force) flag to your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git push</code>
 command <strong>this time, and this time only</strong>:</p>

    <div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp"> $</span><span class="w"> </span>git push <span class="nt">-f</span> origin master
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ol>

<!-- E. Git Checkoff

Once you've verified that your code was pushed to GitHub, put your name down on the lab whiteboard to get your Git exercise (from Part C) checked off. The TA or lab
assistant, upon completion of the lab checkoff, will tell you what to put into the magic word file in order to pass the autograder. If there's a wait, feel free to move on to part F until your name is called.

<p>In the lab1 folder, you should see a file called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LeapYear.java</code>. This program is supposed to test whether or not a given year is a Leap Year. The user will
give a year as a command line parameter (examples given below), and then print out whether or not that year is a leap year, e.g.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ java LeapYear 2000
2000 is a leap year.
$ java LeapYear 1999
1999 is not a leap year.
$ java LeapYear 2004
2004 is a leap year.
$ java LeapYear 2100
2100 is not a leap year.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A leap year is either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>divisible by 400 or</li>
  <li>divisible by 4 and not by 100.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, 2000 and 2004 are leap years. 1900, 2003, and 2100 are not leap years.</p>

<p>Your code must declare a method as follows: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">public static boolean
isLeapYear(int year)</code>. This method will be tested by the Gradescope autograder. Make sure to provide a description of the method as a comment. Your description should be contained by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/**</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*/</code>. Comments contained by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/**</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*/</code> are also called “Javadoc comments” or just “Javadocs”. These comments can span multiple lines if they need the extra space, e.g. the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">checkLeapYear</code> Javadocs.</p>

<p>Javadocs may contain optional tags, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@param</code>. We do not require you to use any tags like this in 61B except the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@source</code> tag. Use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@source</code> tag any time you receive significant help on a project. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@source</code> tag is not required for HW or lab, though we recommend it anyway, since it’s a good scholarly and professional habit to cite your sources.</p>

<p>Some Java tips:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%</code> operator implements remainder. Thus, the value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">year % 4</code> will be
 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2</code>, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3</code>.</li>
  <li>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!=</code> operator compares two values for inequality. The code fragment <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if
 (year % 4 != 0)</code> reads as “if the remainder when dividing year by 4 is not
 equal to 0.”</li>
  <li>When one of the arguments of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">+</code> operator is a String, the arguments are
 concatenated as Strings. For example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"horse"</code> + <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"babies"</code> would return
 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"horsebabies"</code></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="f-submitting-lab-1">F. Submitting Lab 1</h2>

<p>The last step is to submit your work with Gradescope. Gradescope is the site that you’ll use to
submit homework, lab, and project assignments. To sign up for Gradescope (if you haven’t already),
head to <a href="http://gradescope.com">gradescope.com</a> and click on the white “Sign up for
free” button in the middle. You should use your Berkeley email. You should have already been enrolled
in our Gradescope page with your Berkeley email.</p>

<!--
**NOTE (as of 8/3/2020)**
If you are completing this lab well before the start of the semester, and you are not enrolled
in our Gradescope, it is likely because you are not officially enrolled (or waitlisted) in the course
yet. If this is the case, please do not post on Ed asking us to enroll you. Instead, you can use our public
Gradescope page (enrollment code MB7ZPY) to test your code before being enrolled into our real Gradescope.-->

<p>Once you’re enrolled in the class on Gradescope, click on “Lab 1: Welcome to Java” to 
submit your code.</p>

<p>After clicking this button, you’ll be taken to a screen where you select your
repository and branch (shown below). The first time you do this, you’ll have to link
your GitHub account to Gradescope (similar to what you did on the registration website).
Click the “Connect to GitHub” button and follow the instructions.</p>

<p>Now select your repository and branch. If your repository is “fa20-s1”, you’ll select
“fa20-s1” in the top box, and in the bottom box you’ll pick “master”.</p>

<p>Later, you can create your own “branches” (as described in the advanced part of the Git Guide) if you want those graded instead,
though that won’t be required in 61B.</p>

<p><img src="img/github_repo_and_branch_selection.png" alt="Github Repo and Branch Selection" /></p>

<p>Now press “Upload” to submit!</p>

<p>Please report any issues you may have to Ed. Entire error messages
and/or screenshots are welcome.</p>

<p><strong><em>Important:</em></strong> <em>We HIGHLY encourage you to make frequent commits!</em> <strong>Lack of
proper version control will not be considered an excuse for lost work,
particularly after the first few weeks.</strong></p>
