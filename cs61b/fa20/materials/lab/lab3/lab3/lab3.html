  <li>
    <p><a href="https://fa20.datastructur.es/materials/guides/plugin.html#using-the-plugin">Installing and Using the IntelliJ Plugin</a>:
Make sure you’ve had a chance to install and use the CS61B and Java Visualizer IntelliJ plugins.
<strong>Make sure you know how to check style with the plugin.</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make sure your version of the CS61B Plugin is at least <strong>2.0.0</strong> and your version
of the Java Visualizer is at least <strong>2.0.1</strong>. To do this go to Configure <strong>&gt;</strong>
Plugins <strong>&gt;</strong> Installed. You should see a list of plugins, including these two
plugins. Click on each, and the version number should show to the right of the name.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>In this lab, you will learn about Unit Testing, JUnit, the 61B style checker,
and we’ll also get a bit more debugging experience.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-junit">What is JUnit?</h4>
<p><a href="https://junit.org/junit4/">JUnit</a> is a Unit Testing Framework for Java.</p>

<h4 id="what-is-unit-testing">What is Unit Testing?</h4>
<p>Unit Testing is a great way to rigorously test each method of your code and
ultimately ensure that you have a working project.</p>

<p>The “Unit” part of Unit Testing comes from the idea that you can break your
program down into units, or the smallest testable part of an application.
Therefore, Unit Testing enforces good code structure (each method should only do
“One Thing”), and allows you to consider all of the edge cases for each method
and test for them individually.</p>

<p>In this class, you will be using JUnit to create and run tests on your code to
ensure its correctness. And when JUnit tests fail, you will have an excellent
starting point for debugging. Furthermore, if you have some terrible bug that is
hard to fix, you can use git to revert back to a state when your code was
working properly according to the JUnit tests.</p>

<h4 id="junit-syntax">JUnit Syntax</h4>
<p>JUnit tests are written in Java, similar to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LinkedListDequeTest</code> from Project
1A. However, the JUnit library implements all the boring stuff like printing
error messages, making test writing much simpler.</p>

<p>To see an example JUnit test, navigate to the Arithmetic directory and open
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ArithmeticTest.java</code> in your favorite text editor (don’t open IntelliJ just
yet).</p>

<p>The first thing you’ll notice are the imports at the top (IntelliJ sometimes
shortens these to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">import ...</code>; just click on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">...</code> to expand this and
see what exactly is being imported). These imports are what give you easy
access to the JUnit methods and functionality that you’ll need to run JUnit
tests. For more information, see the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8FaHk7qbOD4ZfVY8g8lo5dFrLP-ctGmT">Testing lecture video</a>.</p>

<p>Next, you’ll see that there are two methods in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ArithmeticTest.java</code>:
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">testProduct</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">testSum</code>. These methods follow this format:</p>

<div class="language-java highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nd">@Test</span>
<span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">testMethod</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="n">assertEquals</span><span class="o">(&lt;</span><span class="n">expected</span><span class="o">&gt;,</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">actual</span><span class="o">&gt;);</span>
<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">assertEquals</code> is a common method used in JUnit tests. It tests whether a
variable’s actual value is equivalent to its expected value.</p>

<p>When you create JUnit test files, you should precede each test method with a
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@Test</code> annotation, and can have one or more <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">assertEquals</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">assertTrue</code>
methods (provided by the JUnit library). <strong>All tests must be non-static.</strong>
This may seem weird since your tests don’t use instance variables and you
probably won’t instantiate the class. However, this is how the designers of
JUnit decided tests should be written, so we’ll go with it.</p>

<p>From this point forwards in 61B, we will officially be working in IntelliJ. If
you want to run your code from the terminal, refer to <a href="../../lab3supplement/lab3supplement.html">this supplemental
guide</a>.
While you’re welcome to do this, the staff will not provide official support for
command line compilation and execution or other text editors/IDEs.</p>

<h2 id="setting-up-junit-configurations">Setting up JUnit configurations</h2>
<p>We will need to do a tad bit more to set up JUnit to be as helpful as possible
for us. Specifically, we’ll be adding what are called <strong>VM options</strong> for
IntelliJ to use whenever we’re running a JUnit test or test suite. VM options
are meta-options that the JVM is given that can alter the way things are run,
and we want to add just 1 VM option that will make NullPointerException
messages much easier to understand.</p>

<p>Firstly, go to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">File</code> &gt; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">New Project Settings</code> &gt; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Run Configuration Templates for New
Projects...</code> and click it</p>

<p><img src="img/configuration_location.png" alt="Configurations Location" /></p>

<p>Now, on the left side, you should click on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JUnit</code>. In the text bar labeled <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">VM
options</code>, you should delete whatever might already be there and paste the
following:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>-XX:+ShowCodeDetailsInExceptionMessages
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It should look like this:</p>

<p><img src="img/vm_options.png" alt="VM Options" /></p>

<p>Go ahead and hit <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Apply</code> then <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OK</code> in the bottom right corner.</p>

<p>Now, any future IntelliJ projects you open will have this VM option set.</p>

<h2 id="running-junit-tests-in-intellij-or-another-ide">Running JUnit Tests in IntelliJ (or another IDE)</h2>

<p>Open up IntelliJ and import/open your lab 3 folder that you
pulled from the skeleton. Repeat the steps from Lab 2 Setup, <a href="https://fa20.datastructur.es/materials/lab/lab2setup/lab2setup#project-setup">Project
Setup</a> and don’t forget to import the javalib libraries!</p>

<p>Open up <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lab3/Arithmetic/ArithmeticTest.java</code> in IntelliJ. Now click the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Run...</code> option under the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Run</code>
menu at the top of IntelliJ as shown in the following screenshot.</p>

<p><img src="img/lab3_run.png" alt="Run Options" /></p>

<p>After clicking “Run…”, you should some number of options that will look
something like the list below. The number of items in your list may vary.</p>

<p><img src="img/lab3_run_menu.png" alt="Run Options" /></p>

<p>The option we care about is the one that says “ArithmeticTest” next to the red
and green arrows (next to the 1. in the image above).</p>

<p>Select this one, and you should see something like:</p>

<p><img src="img/default_renderer.png" alt="Run Options" /></p>

<p>This is saying that the test on line 25 of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ArithmeticTest.java</code> failed. The test
expected 5 + 6 to be 11, but the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arithmetic</code> class claims 5 + 6 is 30. You’ll
see that even though <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">testSum</code> includes many <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">assert</code> statements, only one
failure is shown.</p>

<p>This is because JUnit tests are short-circuiting – as soon as one of the asserts
in a method fails, it will output the failure and move on to the next test.</p>

<p>Try clicking on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ArithmeticTest.java:25</code> in the window at the bottom of the
screen and IntelliJ will take you straight to the line which caused the test to
fail. This can come in handy when running your own tests on later projects.</p>

<p>Now fix the bug, either by inspecting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Arithmetic.java</code> and finding the bug, or
using the IntelliJ debugger to step through the code until you reach the bug.</p>

<p>After fixing the bug, rerun the test, and if you’re using the default renderer,
you should get a nice glorious green bar. Enjoy the rush.</p>

<h2 id="intdlists">IntDLists</h2>

<p>Now a real-CS61B application of JUnit tests: IntLists. We’re going to go through
a short debugging exercise in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BuggyIntDList.java</code>. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BuggyIntDList</code> is a buggy
implementation of a doubly linked int list. There are 2 files involved in this
exercise.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BuggyIntDList.java</code>: contains two buggy methods: sortedMerge and reverse.
You will be tasked with fixing these two methods.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BuggyIntDListTest.java</code>: contains set of tests for these buggy methods. Once
these methods are fixed correctly, all of the tests should pass.</li>
</ul>

<p>Within <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BuggyIntDList.java</code> you will need to debug two functions. The first
function is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mergeIntDLists</code>, which merges two sorted <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IntDLists</code> into a single
sorted <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IntDList</code> by calling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sortedMerge</code>. This is a driver method that just
calls <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sortedMerge</code> method with front DNodes of both <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IntDLists</code>. This method
should be destructive.</p>

<p>One note before you start: The tests we provide you are all that’s required to
pass the autograder. However, you’ll notice that the tests immediately test
large <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IntDLists</code> which may be daunting to debug. We encourage you to write
tests that start with smaller cases to practice writing tests and to make your
debugging experience easier.</p>

<p>Try running the main method in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BuggyIntDListTest.java</code> and see what the output
is in Run window. You will observe that the two test cases <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">testReverse</code> and
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">testMergeIntDList</code> have failed with some problems. Click on the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">testMergeIntDList</code> in the debugging panel with a red exclamation sign in left
pane. You will see the following details:</p>

<p><img src="img/mergeintdlist_stacktrace.png" alt="Merge Stack Trace" /></p>

<p>There are a few important things to note here. First, we can read the type of
exception that was thrown - <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NullPointerException</code>. To read the Oracle docs on
what a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NullPointerException</code> is, take a look <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/lang/NullPointerException.html">here</a>. To summarize what they
say, a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NullPointerException</code> is thrown when null is used where an object is
required (for example, trying to call an instance method of a null object, or
accessing or modifying the instance variables of a null object). The VM option
we added earlier makes this message even more specific: the code is trying to
access the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">val</code> attribute of variable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">d2</code> but <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">d2</code> is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">null</code>.</p>

<p>Next, we can see the stack trace. This is a listing of all functions that were
called before the exception was thrown. The stack trace can be read
chronologically from bottom to top - that is, first the method <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">testMergeIntDList</code>
was called, and then <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mergeIntDList</code> was called, and then the method <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sortedMerge</code>
was called. Since <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sortedMerge</code> is at the top of our stack trace, we know that
it was this function in which the exception was thrown. The stack trace also
provides us the exact line numbers where functions are called.</p>

<p>Use the stack trace, along with the skeleton code provided to you to fix the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sortedMerge</code> method in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BuggyIntDList.java</code>.</p>

<p>Once you understand what a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NullPointerException</code> is, the next question is why
would this occur? To answer this, use the IntelliJ Debugger and set a break
point at the line 32 in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BuggyIntDList.java</code> which is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sortedMerge</code> method and
click Debug in Run menu.</p>

<p>It also highly recommended that you understand how to efficiently debug your
code using breakpoints, Step Over, Step Into and Step Out functionality in
IntelliJ. We have put up a <a href="../../../guides/debugging-guide.html">Debugging Guide</a>
for easy reference. Make sure you go through it if you do not understand how
to debug code. We will be using this guide as reference in all the future labs,
homeworks and projects.</p>

<p>Now that we know the error, and the line the error occurs on, we need to reflect
on what could be causing this error. Are we trying to access an instance
variable of a null object? How did that object become null? Should it be allowed
to be null? These are questions you should ask yourself to hone down the bug to
its source. Write additional lines of code in the designated space (if needed)
to fix the problem.</p>

<p>After you think you’ve solved the problem, try running the tests again to see
if the method is performing its functionality correctly. There are multiple
issues with the method and might need more than one line changed to be fixed.</p>

<p>Let us now move on to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">reverse</code> and understand what the test failure means:</p>

<p><img src="img/reverse-stacktrace.png" alt="Merge Stack Trace" /></p>

<p>We observe that the test is marked with a yellow cross in left pane of debugger
window instead of a red one. It indicates that the test was able to run
successfully without any exception, but is not performing as expected.</p>

<p>Try drawing a box and pointer diagram, or using the Java Visualizer. When does
this error occur, and what would be the simplest fix? Implement your fixes by
editing the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">reverse</code> function. To check that your reverse implementation is
correct, complete the following tasks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Draw a box and pointer diagram (or use the visualizer) to see what your code
is doing, and verify you are assigning all pointers correctly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Write your own comprehensive tests to verify the functionality of your code.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Although not required for this lab, you are encouraged to write your own unit
tests by creating new java files named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MyBuggyIntDListTest.java</code> if you feel
like it. Writing proper and comprehensive unit tests is essential in making sure
that your methods have been correctly implemented and working as expected for
various scenarios which we call edge cases. Make sure to submit those files as
well, if you end up creating more tests.</p>

<h2 id="a-debugging-mystery">A Debugging Mystery</h2>

<p>Another important skill to learn is how to exhaustively debug. When done
properly, debugging should allow you to rapidly narrow down where a bug might be
located, even when you are debugging code you don’t fully understand. Consider
the following scenario:</p>

<p>Your company, Flik Enterprises, has released a fine software library called
Flik.java that is able to determine whether two Integers are the same or not.</p>

<p>You receive an email from someone named “Horrible Steve” who describes a problem
they’re having with your library:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>"Dear Flik Enterprises,

Your library is very bad. See the attached code. It should print out 500
but actually it's printing out 128.

(attachment: HorribleSteve.java)"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Using any combination of the following techniques, figure out whether the bug is
in Horrible Steve’s code or in Flik enterprise’s library:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Writing JUnit tests for the Flik library. If you want to try this, you will
 to create a new file in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Flik</code> directory and import <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">junit</code>. Look to the
 tests from the previous problems for how to do this.</li>
  <li><strong>Using the IntelliJ debugger, especially <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/2016.3/configuring-breakpoints.html">conditional breakpoints</a> or <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/using-breakpoints.html#exception-breakpoints">breaking on exceptions</a> (try this: Run -&gt; View Breakpoints -&gt; Check “Java Exceptions Breakpoints” -&gt; Uncheck “Caught Exceptions”).</strong></li>
  <li>Using print statements.</li>
  <li>Refactoring Horrible Steve’s code. Refactoring means changing the syntax
without changing the functionality. This may be hard to do since HS’s code
uses lots of weird stuff.</li>
</ul>

<p>HorribleSteve.java and Flik.java both use syntax we haven’t covered in class.
<strong>We do not expect you to fix the bug or even understand why it’s happening once
you have found it.</strong> Instead, your job is simply to find the bug.</p>

<p>Tip: JUnit provides methods <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">assertTrue(boolean)</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">assertTrue(String,
boolean)</code> that you might find helpful.</p>

<p>Try to come up with a short explanation of the bug! Google is your friend since
we have not covered this exact issue in Lecture. Discuss with your lab partner
and check in with your TA or an AI to see if your answer is right (not for a
grade).</p>

<h2 id="running-the-61b-style-checker">Running the 61B Style Checker</h2>

<p>We will be using the CS 61B IntelliJ Plugin to check for style (right click on
the file, then select “Check Style”). Try it out on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BuggyIntDList.java</code> in your
IntDList folder. You should see that there are a lot of style errors. Most of
these should already be resolved if you replaced all the FIXMEs with your code,
but if not, you should resolve these errors. If you’re ever stuck on style
issues, consult the <a href="https://fa20.datastructur.es/materials/guides/style-guide">official 61B style guide</a>.</p>

<p>When you pass the style check, the output should look like:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Running style checker on 1 file(s)...
Style checker completed with 0 errors
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="submission">Submission</h2>

<p>As before, push your code to GitHub and submit to Gradescope to test your code.</p>
