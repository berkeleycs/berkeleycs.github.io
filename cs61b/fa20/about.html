<p><strong>These policies are still in beta and have not been fully reviewed, but will
be very close to what is described below. Sorry for any errors or omissions.</strong></p>

<h2 id="general-background-information">General Background Information</h2>

<h3 id="welcome-to-cs-61b">Welcome to CS 61B</h3>
<p>The CS 61 series is an introduction to computer science, with particular
emphasis on software and machines from a programmer’s point of view. CS 61A
covered high-level approaches to problem-solving, providing you with a variety
of ways to organize solutions to programming problems as compositions of
functions, collections of objects, or sets of rules. In CS 61B, we move to a
somewhat more detailed (and to some extent, more basic) level of programming.</p>

<p>In 61A, the <em>correctness</em> of a program was our primary goal. In CS61B, we’re
concerned also with <em>engineering</em>. An engineer, it is said, is someone who can
do for a dime what any fool can do for a dollar. Much of 61B will be concerned
with the tradeoffs in time and memory for a variety of methods for structuring
data.  We’ll also be concerned with the engineering knowledge and skills needed
to build and maintain moderately large programs.</p>

<h3 id="background-knowledge">Background Knowledge</h3>
<p>This class assumes you have taken CS61A, CS88, or E7, or have equivalent
background to a student who has taken one of these courses. The course is
largely built upon the assumption that you have taken CS61A or CS88, and E7
students may find the beginning of the course to be a bit scarier, particularly
when it comes to object oriented programming.</p>

<p>We assume you are coming in with zero Java experience. Nonetheless, we will move
through basic Java syntax very quickly. Though the syntaxes of Java, Python,
MATLAB, Scheme, etc. are enormously different, the underlying computational
models are surprisingly similar.</p>

<p>If you already have Java experience, great! We hope that you’ll help out your
fellow students in discussion, lab, and on our class forum, particularly in the opening
weeks when everyone is catching up on Java.</p>

<p>Knowledge of UNIX is not required, though you might find it useful if you want
to use the lab computers instead of your own computer. Lab 1 will give you
resources to learn UNIX if you end up deciding to use the lab computers instead of
your own.</p>

<h3 id="is-this-the-right-course-for-me">Is this the right course for me?</h3>
<p>This is a course about data structures and programming methods. It happens to
also teach Java, since it is hard to teach programming without a language.
However, it is not intended as an exhaustive course on Java,
creating Android apps, user interfaces, graphics, or any of that fun stuff.</p>

<p>Some of you may have already taken a data structures course, and simply want to
learn Java or C++. For you, self-study may be a better option. CS 9F (C++ for
programmers) and CS 9G (Java for programmers) are both one-unit self-paced
courses that will teach you more of what you want to know in less time. There is
no enrollment limit for that course, and you work through it at your own pace
after the first and only lecture.</p>

<p>Finally, the 1-unit self-paced course CS 47B is for students “with sufficient
partial credit in 61B,” allowing them (with instructor’s permission) to complete
the 61B course requirement without taking the full course. The 47B guide is <a href="materials/47b/47b.html">at
this link</a>.</p>

<h3 id="lectures-discussion-and-lab-sections">Lectures, Discussion and Lab Sections</h3>

<p>Rather than presenting lecture material during our officially scheduled lecture time of MWF, 1-2, Josh Hug will lead a live Q&amp;A session with no specific pre-planned activities.</p>

<p>Lecture material will instead be presented in pre-recorded videos, currently available on the course website. However, lecture #1 and at least one of the live lectures will be presented live during the regularly scheduled period.</p>

<p>Each week there is a 1 hour discussion section and a 2 hour lab section headed
by a GSI and supported by academic interns. Information about the staff
running each section can be found on the <a href="http://fa20.datastructur.es/staff">staff</a> page.</p>

<p>Discussion and lab attendance are not usually mandatory, but attendance earns
you 4 pacing points, which are described in more detail below.</p>

<p>There are 3 labs for which attendance is mandatory for full credit: Lab 2, Lab
4 (project 1 code review lab), and Lab 14 (project 3 checkoff lab).</p>

<!--There will be two types of discussion sections:
 - Standard: Assumes exposure to lecture material. Reinforcement of class fundamentals.
 - Exam prep: Assumes solid understanding. Hard exam-level (and beyond) problems.
-->

<p>Labs are worth part of the course grade. Points are earned by submitting working code 
to gradescope. Lab materials are available online, so you will be able to do
much of the work ahead of time if you prefer.</p>

<h3 id="lab-discussion-and-mentor-gsis">Lab, Discussion, and Mentor GSIs</h3>

<p>We will release lab and discussion section signups shortly before classes start. Details TBA.</p>

<p>In addition, you may also choose a mentor GSI. Your mentor GSI does not necessarily have to be your lab or discussion GSI. If you do not choose a mentor GSI, one will be assigned for you randomly. Details TBA.</p>

<p>Your mentor GSI will keep an eye out for you, and will also be your point-of-contact for issues when you need help or advice.</p>

<h3 id="online-resources">Online Resources</h3>
<p>The <a href="index.html">course home page</a> will provide one-stop shopping for course information.
The course schedule as well as all handouts, homework, labs, FAQs, etc., will be
posted there.</p>

<p>Our discussion forum this semester will be <a href="http://fa20.datastructur.es/us.edstem.org/courses/979/discussion/">Ed Discussions</a>. For most
questions about the course, Ed is the right place to ask them. The course
staff reads it regularly, so you will get a quick answer. Furthermore, by posting
online as opposed to emailing us directly, other students benefit by seeing the
question and the answer. Don’t forget to check Ed before asking your
question, just in case someone else has already posted it.</p>

<p>The e-mail address <span class="blue">cs61b (at) berkeley.edu</span> will send a
message to the course staff (Josh and the head TAs). You can use it for
correspondence that you don’t want to seen on our class forum. The head TAs and Josh all read it, so you
will usually get a quick reply. If you send a question that is of general
interest, we may post the response on Ed (we will keep personal information
out of it, of course). If you have any problems that require an exception to course policy 
(e.g. medical emergencies or sudden necessary travel that result in extended absences), please contact 
<span class="blue">cs61b (at) berkeley.edu</span>. <strong>Please do not email
Josh for exceptions. Email</strong> <b><span class="blue">cs61b (at) berkeley.edu</span></b>.</p>

<p>Rather than using bcourses, we will be using our own custom learning management
system called Beacon <a href="http://fa20.datastructur.es/fa20.beacon.datastructur.es">fa20.beacon.datastructur.es</a>.
You can use Beacon to keep track of your grades and late assignments, and you
will also use it to specify your lab partner and mentor GSI.</p>

<!--
To talk with us, the best way is to come during regular office hours (posted on
the home page). Many of us are available at other times by appointment. Please
don't be shy. Web pages, email, and Ed are useful, but it's still much
easier to understand something when you can talk about it face-to-face. Office
hours will be concentrated Monday to Wednesday because we hold labs all day Thursday and Friday.-->

<h3 id="course-materials">Course Materials</h3>
<p><strong>There is no required textbook for the class.</strong></p>

<p>There is an online textbook written by myself and a large team of former GSIs.
It can be found at <a href="https://joshhug.gitbooks.io/hug61b">https://joshhug.gitbooks.io/hug61b</a>.</p>

<p>If you find these notes insufficient, you might consider consulting <a href="http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/fa14/book1/java.pdf">Paul
Hilfinger’s (free) Java
Reference</a> or
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=head+first+java">Head First Java, 2nd Edition by Sierra and Bates (O’Reilly,
2005)</a>. These are not required for the course.</p>

<p>The optional textbook for the weeks 5-14 of the course is Algorithms, 4th
Edition by Wayne and Sedgewick.</p>

<p>All textbooks for this course are optional. Homework will not be assigned from
them. Only alternate readings will be provided from them when possible.</p>

<p>The official description of the Java core language is available online in <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se14/html">The
Java Language Specification</a>
(Java SE 14 Edition) by James Gosling, Bill Joy, Guy Steele, Gilad Bracha,
Alex Buckley, and Daniel Smith. It’s extremely thorough and easy to read (once
you understand how
to read it).</p>

<h3 id="software">Software</h3>
<p>This official coding environment and text editor for the course is the
Integrated Development Environment (IDE) called IntelliJ, though we will not
introduce this IDE until Week 2. At your own discretion, you may instead use
Vim, Emacs, Sublime, or IDEs like Eclipse, Netbeans, etc. Whatever you
use, however, your submitted solutions must conform to our expected style guide. We strongly recommend that you use IntelliJ
starting as soon as you finish project 0. We will not officially support any
editing / programming environment other than IntelliJ.</p>

<p>This semester, we will use Java 14.</p>

<p>You will be able to do any work you’d like on any Windows, Mac OS X, or Linux
computer. You may also remotely log into the instructional machines (which you
will receive an account for during the first week), though you should be able to do everything in the course by working natively on your own computer.
Information for setting up your own computer is linked in <a href="http://fa20.datastructur.es/materials/lab/lab1b">Lab
1b</a>.</p>

<p>We’ll be using the version-control system <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> this
semester. Version-control systems allow you to maintain a series of “snapshots” of
your files at various points in their development. Used properly, this provides
you some back-up protection, so that you can recover previous states of your
work when something goes wrong. Also for team-oriented projects (as well as in
the real world), version-control systems help manage collaborative work.</p>

<p>You will be learning and using Git for this course to track your work and submit
your assignments. In addition to the advantages above, using Git will allow the
staff to track your progress in the course and maybe even help you out when
you’re stuck on bugs. The first lab will teach you the basics of what you will
need to know. Feel free to also read official <a href="http://git-scm.com/doc">Git
documentation</a>.</p>

<h2 id="expected-coursework">Expected Coursework</h2>

<p>There are five required aspects of the course for which you earn points:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Weekly Check-in Surveys</li>
  <li>HWs</li>
  <li>Lab Assignments</li>
  <li>Projects</li>
  <li>Exams</li>
</ol>

<p>In addition, you may also earn extra credit by completing additional surveys.</p>

<h3 id="weekly-check-in-survey">Weekly Check-in Survey</h3>

<p>While lecture attendance is not required, nor even expected, we do expect you to stay up to date with lecture material. To help keep you on track, there will be 14 weekly check-in surveys due on Sundays at 11:59 PM. These surveys will also be used to keep track of attendance for discussion and lab.</p>

<p>Each weekly check-in survey is worth 16 points, for a total of 160 points. Only your top 10 weekly surveys are counted (out of 14). No late surveys will be accepted.</p>

<h3 id="hw-and-lab-assignments">HW and Lab Assignments</h3>
<p>There are 14 weeks of lab in the course, as well as 3 required homeworks.</p>

<p>During Phase I of the course (Weeks 1
through 5), labs will provide you with help getting your computer set up and
teach you how to use essential Java programming tools.</p>

<p>During Phases II and III of the course (Weeks 6 - 14), standard labs will
usually involve implementation of some data structure or algorithm described in lecture.</p>

<p>All labs should take no more than two hours to complete, though some may run
slightly longer. HWs will vary from 3 to 10 hours of work. You will turn in
everything electronically using GitHub, and your results will be available on
Gradescope.</p>

<p>All homeworks are submitted individually (without partners),
but you may work with other students subject to the collaboration rules
described below. If you attend live labs (on Discord), you must submit with a partner 
starting with lab 3. See the lab partner section below for more details.</p>

<p>Homework will be graded on a rigorous suite of correctness tests while labs will
receive full credit for “reasonable effort,” as evaluated by a small number of
relatively simple correctness tests. Passing all tests on Gradescope for
homework or labs will ensure full credit as there are no hidden tests. Each of the 12 labs
will be worth 32 points (for a total of 384 points), and each homework will be
worth 160 points (for a total of 480 points). No homeworks or labs will be
dropped.</p>

<h3 id="lab-partners">Lab Partners</h3>

<p>Coronavirus makes the world lonely. This semester, we are allowing lab partners 
for labs. You will be able to select your own lab partner or have one randomly
selected for you. Your lab partner will be formally specified using
Beacon. Details will be provided in the lab 2 spec. You will be able to dissolve
lab partnerships by making a request to your mentor GSI. Details on lab
partnerships can be found <a href="http://fa20.datastructur.es/materials/guides/partnerships">at this link</a>.</p>

<p>Having a partner is optional for labs. Note that there will be 3 labs with
mandatory attendance for all students. In these labs there will be an assignment
for which you will have to get checked-off by a TA. If you choose to not attend
a lab regularly, for the mandatory check-offs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Lab 2: You will be able to get checked off in office hours.</li>
  <li>Lab 15: There will be official sign ups for this checkoff, in which you and your partner will present the work you completed for Project 3.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you absolutely cannot make any lab time for these mandatory check-offs fill out this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScLqkCCKpwIunVvZeID5KlMCDaOLL835y1mVczbfecvXoHu9w/viewform?usp=sf_link">form</a>. This is applicable only to students who live in countries in which all of our lab times would be in unreasonable times for their time zone.</p>

<h3 id="programming-projects">Programming Projects</h3>
<p>In addition to the HWs and labs, there will be 4 programming projects. In these
projects you will build an entire system. All projects except project 3 must
be completed on your own. For project 3 you will be
required to work with a partner, unless you specifically request otherwise. If you think you can’t work with a partner on this proejct, please fill out this <a href="https://forms.gle/3XZsQG71h9WUJ36k9">form</a>. Note that requests to work alone are very unlikely to be approved.</p>

<p>Project 0 and 1 will be relatively easier than projects 2 and 3, taking less
time and with greater levels of scaffolding. Project 2 will be a difficult
project (on par with what you might expect from a Hilfinger projects), though
it will be spread over a long period of time. Project 3 will be an even 
more difficult capstone project in which you will design a project from scratch.</p>

<p>Each project has a specific theme:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Project 0 (NBody): Introduction to Java</li>
  <li>Project 1 (Deques): Basic Design, Testing, and Code Review</li>
  <li>Project 2 (BearMaps): Testing and Large Scale Implementation</li>
  <li>Project 3 (BYOW): Large Scale Design</li>
</ul>

<p>For projects 0 and 1, we will ultimately release all tests that determine your
grade. In other words, passing all tests on Gradescope will allow you to earn
full points for the autograded portion of the project.</p>

<p>Project 2A and 2B will have no publicly available tests. It will be up to you to 
verify the correctness of your implementation. All tests for Project 2C will be
available.</p>

<p>Project 3 will have an autograded portion and a checkoff portion. All tests will
be released for the autograder portion.</p>

<p>Projects 0, 1, 2, and 3 will be worth 200, 320, 800, and 800 points
respectively. For each project, there are opportunities for “gold points”
described in each project specification.</p>

<p>Project 1 will be broken into 2 parts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>200 points (project 1A - Deques)</li>
  <li>120 points (project 1B - Deques II)</li>
</ul>

<p>Project 2 will be broken into 3 parts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>160 points (project 2A - KdTrees)</li>
  <li>320 points (project 2B - HeapMinPQ)</li>
  <li>160 points (project 2C - Puzzle Solver)</li>
  <li>160 points (project 2D - Bear Maps)</li>
</ul>

<p>Project 3 will be broken into 5 parts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>200 points (phase 1 - World Generator)</li>
  <li>200 points (phase 2 - World Explorer)</li>
  <li>40 points (partner review #1)</li>
  <li>40 points (partner review #2)</li>
  <li>320 points (lab demo)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="exams">Exams</h3>

<!--There will be two evening midterms on February 20th from 8 - 10 PM and on April 5th from 8 - 10 PM. There will also be a three hour final exam Wednesday May 15th at 7 PM.-->

<p>Exam dates and times will be posted soon. Midterm 1 will be worth 640 points,
midterm 2 will be worth 960 points, and the final exam will be worth 1600
points.</p>

<p>You will be allowed to use unlimited handwritten sheets of notes on all exams.
You will not be required to turn in these sheets, and you
may reuse them from exam to exam.</p>

<p>Inspired by the great Paul Hilfinger tradition, exam questions may cover any material
whatsoever. For fear of our lives, exams will almost exclusively test material
covered in the course.</p>

<p>There will be <strong>no alternate midterm exams</strong>. If you miss an exam, your score will be
reweighted with your performance on other exams (see “supersession” elsewhere in this document). Students with disabilities that require alternate exam timing will be honored, so long as you can make a time that overlaps the official time. If you have a disability that prevents your ability to make such a time, we will discuss alternate arrangements with you directly. If you are traveling on official UC business, and have a proctor available, we will allow remote exams to be taken at the same time as the official exam.</p>

<p>Alternate finals will be given in case of a direct final conflict only. If you miss a
final exam due to illness, you will be given an incomplete grade in the course and
will have to complete the final exam during a future semester.</p>

<p>We release grades for exams on <a href="https://gradescope.com/">Gradescope</a>. If you
believe we have misgraded an exam, request a regrade on the same site with a
note explaining your complaint.  You should check the online solutions first to
make sure that this regrade will make your total score go up as it is possible
to lose points from a regrade request.</p>

<p>Due to the university level change in drop deadlines, Midterm 1 grades will be unavailable before
the drop deadline. If you’re a prospective CS major and you are worried about dropping
the course in the time before the drop deadline, we will provide advising sessions 
to help you decide what to do. Details will be announced at that time.</p>

<h4 id="exam-supersession">Exam Supersession</h4>

<p>For those of you who miss an exam, have a bad night, or make major improvements over the semester, the exam supersession policy gives you a chance to replace potentially both of your midterm exam scores.</p>

<p>Specifically, if it helps your score, we will replace your midterm scores by their “final statistical equivalent” (FSE). We compute the FSE of an exam as follows:</p>

<p>Let \(F\) be the number of standard deviations above the mean that you score on the final. For example, if you are 0.3 standard deviations below the mean, \(F=-0.3\). Let \(\overline{M}\) be the class-wide mean (not including zeroes) on an midterm. Let \(\sigma_M\) be the class-wide standard deviations (not including zeroes) on a midterm. Your FSE for that exam is \(\sigma_MF + \overline{M}\). The FSE cannot go above the maximum possible score for that exam.</p>

<p>If your FSEs is better than your original midterm score, we will use the FSE instead. If both are better (e.g. you do much better on the final than either midterm), then we will replace both of the midterm scores. If both of your FSE are worse, nothing happens (i.e. doing badly on the final won’t hurt your earlier exam scores).</p>

<p>Your grade can only go up with the supersession policy, so if replacing your
midterm scores with their FSE makes your grade lower we will not do that.</p>

<p>In pseudocode, supersession works as follows:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>F = (your_final_score - final_mean) / final_stddev

FSE_m1 = min(m1_stddev * F + m1_mean, 640) // the max score for midterm 1 is 640
FSE_m2 = min(m2_stddev * F + m2_mean, 960) // the max score for midterm 2 is 960

score_with_m1_replaced = FSE_m1 + your_m2_score + your_final_score
score_with_m2_replaced = your_m1_score + FSE_m2 + your_final_score
score_with_m1_and_m2_replaced = FSE_m1 + FSE_m2 + your_final_score
score_with_no_replacements = your_m1_score + your_m2_score + your_final_score

your_total_exam_score = max(score_with_m1_replaced, score_with_m2_replaced, score_with_m1_and_m2_replaced, score_with_no_replacements)
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="extra-credit">Extra Credit</h3>
<p>There will be a total of 64 points of extra credit in the course:</p>

<ol>
  <li>16 points for the pre-semester survey.</li>
  <li>16 points for mid-semester survey.</li>
  <li>16 points for taking the staff created end-of-semester survey.</li>
  <li>16 points for taking the official university end-of-semester survey.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="grades">Grades</h2>
<p>Your letter grade will be determined by the total points out of the possible
6,344. In other words, there is <em>no curving in this course</em>, other than the
supersession policy above. Your grade will depend solely on how well you do, and
not on how well everyone else does. Unlike other lower division CS courses, the grading bins
for 61B generally do not get tweaked at the end of the semester.</p>

<p><strong>The bins above are a rough estimate, and will be finalized by August 31st.</strong></p>

<p>These bins were designed to comply with departmental guidelines that the average GPA for a lower-division required course be in the range 2.8 - 3.3, not including students who drop or take the class for a P/NP grade. The design process involved setting of specific standards I expect students to achieve for the A, B, and C bins, with numbers adjusted and other bins interpolated based on a model that I built of predicted student performance. At the end of the semester, we might make the bin boundaries slightly friendlier, though as noted above, unlike other lower division CS courses, I don’t typically move them very much, if at all.</p>

<p>We will grant grades of Incomplete <em>only</em> for dire medical or personal
emergencies that cause you to miss the final, and only if your work up to that
point has been satisfactory. Do <em>not</em> try to get an incomplete simply as a way
to have more time to study or do a project. That is contrary to University
policy.</p>

<h3 id="gold-points-boosting">Gold Points Boosting</h3>
<p>Gold points can be acquired by completing the ‘stretch’ goals on the projects. 
Gold points act sort of like extra credit,
though the lower your exam scores, the more your gold points will count.</p>

<p>If you earn \(g\) gold points and \(T\) points on all exams (after taking into
account exam supersession), then your total score in the course will be boosted by
\(2\left(g - g \cdot \dfrac{T}{3200}\right)\).</p>

<p>For example, if you earn \(16\) gold points on project 2 and have \(1920\) points on your exams including exam supersession, then
you’ll earn a gold boost of \(2\left(16 - 16 \cdot \dfrac{1920}{3200}\right) = 12.8\)
to your total score in the class.</p>

<p>If we decide a project is too difficult, we reserve the right to move some part
of the project into the gold parts section. In such a case, we may readjust the
distribution of gold points.</p>

<h3 id="pacing-points-boosting">Pacing Points Boosting</h3>
<p>There are three ways to earn “pacing” points, which are given for keeping up with the class.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Attending discussions synchronously (on Zoom).</li>
  <li>Attending lab synchronously (on Discord).</li>
  <li>Watching the webcast lecture and completing the check-in exercise by 11:59 PM PST
the day following the official lecture date.</li>
</ol>

<p>For each discussion or lab you earn 4 pacing points. For each lecture you watch
on time, you earn 2 pacing point. You may earn up to a maximum of 120 pacing
points. For example, one way to achieve the maximum number of pacing points
would be: attending 10 discussions in person, 10 labs in person, and keeping up
with 20 lectures. To earn lecture pacing points, you should complete the
“Check-in Exercise” linked under the guide for that lecture. For example, to
earn pacing points for Lecture 5 (DLLists, Arrays), you’d need to watch lecture
5 and complete the check-in exercise by September 5th. Check-in exercised are
done via Google Forms and are linked on the corresponding guide for that lecture.</p>

<p>Pacing points use the same formula as gold points, but cannot increase your score beyond \(4400\). For example, if you earn \(120\) pacing points throughout the semester and have \(1200\) points on your exams including supersession, then you’ll earn a pacing boost of \(2\left(120 - 120 \cdot \dfrac{1200}{3200}\right) = 150\) points on your total score. However, if this pushes your total score above 4400, your score will be set equal to 4400.</p>

<h2 id="policies-on-collaboration-cheating-and-lateness">Policies on Collaboration, Cheating, and Lateness</h2>
<p>Deadlines can be stressful, and we know that under extreme pressure, it becomes
tempting to start rationalizing actions that you would otherwise yourself
consider inappropriate. Perhaps you’ll find yourself facing a 61B project
deadline, and under all this stress you’ll convince yourself that you’re just
going to cheat for the moment so you can get the points, and that you’ll come
back later and really learn the thing you were supposed to have learned in order
to restore your karmic balance (I’ve heard something along these lines a few
times).</p>

<p>This is a terrible idea. Obviously it’s important to learn how to deal with
deadlines, but far more important than that, giving into this sort of pressure
under not-so-dire circumstances is going to do some damage to your moral
compass. Someday, when the consequences are higher than potentially losing a
1/3rd of a letter grade, you may find yourself committing dishonest acts at the
cost of someone else’s livelihood or life.</p>

<p>Plagiarism on any hw, lab or project will result in a score of -200 on that
assignment, which will likely reduce your letter grade by several bins. A second
instance of plagiarism on a homework, lab, or project will result in an F in the
course. All incidents of plagiarism will be referred to the Office of Student
Conduct, including carelessly leaving code up on GitHub. Given our friendly lateness
policy (see below), there will be no exceptions to this rule.</p>

<p>During the Spring 2017 semester, we compiled a series of <a href="http://fa20.datastructur.es/materials/guides/incident-reports-2017.html">incident reports written by students who were caught plagiarizing</a>. If you find yourself tempted to cheat, you might turn to the words of others who have made the wrong choice for guidance.</p>

<h3 id="hw-and-lab-collaboration-policy">HW and Lab Collaboration Policy</h3>
<p>In CS61B, we have three types of assignments: homeworks, labs, and projects. The
entire point of homeworks and labs is to learn. For homeworks or labs, you
should feel free to collaborate with others however you choose, though keep in
mind that greater independence is likely to give you a better learning
experience (as long as you aren’t totally stuck). <strong>Even though we will allow
close collaborations on HWs and labs, your code should still be your own work!</strong>
Identical or near identical submissions will be treated as plagiarism.</p>

<h3 id="project-collaboration-policy">Project Collaboration Policy</h3>
<p>By contrast, the projects were designed not just for learning (particularly how
to be self-reliant in the context of large unfamiliar systems), but also for the
dual purpose of evaluating of your mastery of the course material. As such, they
are intended to be completed primarily on your own (or with your partner for the
first two projects), particularly when it comes to writing the actual code.</p>

<p><strong>For exams, we will be absolutely unforgiving.</strong> Any incident will result in a
failing grade for the course, though Berkeley will let you retake 61B next
semester. As above, all incidents of cheating will be referred to the Office of
Student Conduct.</p>

<p>What constitutes cheating? <strong>The golden rule of academic dishonesty is that you
should not claim to be responsible for work that is not yours.</strong></p>

<p>This is obviously open to some interpretation, and you’ll be getting some help
from instructors, the internet, other students, and more throughout the course.
This is OK, and we hope that the class is an open, welcoming, collaborative
environment where we can help each other build the highest possible
understanding of the course material.
To help (but not entirely define) the bounds of acceptable behavior, we have
three important rules for projects:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>By You Alone</strong>: All project code that you submit (other than skeleton code)
should be written by you (and if applicable, your project 0 or project 2
partner) alone, except for small snippets that solve tiny subproblems
(examples in the Permitted section below).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Do Not Possess or Share Code</strong>: Before you’ve submitted your final work for a project, you should never
be in possession of solution code that you (or your partner) did not write.
You will be equally culpable if you distribute such code to other students or
future students of 61B (within reason). DO NOT GIVE ANYONE YOUR CODE – EVEN
IF THEY ARE DESPERATELY ASKING. DO NOT POST SOLUTIONS TO PROJECTS ONLINE (on
GitHub or anywhere else)! If you’re not sure what you’re doing is OK, please
ask.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Cite Your Sources</strong>: When you receive significant assistance on a project
from someone else, you should cite that assistance somewhere in your source
code with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@source</code> tag as described in lab 1.  We leave it to you to decide what constitutes ‘significant’.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>For clarity, examples of specific activities are listed below:</p>

<p><strong>Permitted</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Discussion of approaches for solving a problem.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Giving away or receiving significant conceptual ideas towards a problem
solution. Such help should be cited as comments in your code. For the sake of
other’s learning experience, we ask that you try not to give away anything
juicy, and instead try to lead people to such solutions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Discussion of specific syntax issues and bugs in your code.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Using small snippets of code that you find online for solving tiny problems
(e.g. googling “uppercase string java” may lead you to some sample code that
you copy and paste into your solution). Such usages should be cited as
comments in your hw, lab, and especially project code!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Permitted with <strong>Extreme Caution</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Looking at someone else’s project code to assist with debugging. Typing or
  dictacting code into someone else’s computer is a violation of the “By You
  Alone” rule.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Looking at someone else’s project code to understand a particular idea or part
  of a project. This is strongly discouraged due to the danger of plagiarism,
  but not absolutely forbidden. We are very serious about the “By You Alone”
  rule!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Working on a project alongside another person or group of people. Your code
  should not substantially resemble anyone else’s!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Absolutely Forbidden</strong>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Possessing another student’s project code in any form before a final deadline,
  be it electronic or on paper. This includes the situation where you’re
  trying to help someone debug. Distributing such code is equally forbidden.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Possessing project solution code that you did not write yourself (from online
  (e.g. GitHub), staff solution code found somewhere on a server it should not
  have been, etc.) before a final deadline. Distributing such code is equally
  forbidden.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Posting solution code to any assignment in a public place (e.g. a public git
  repository, mediafire, etched into stones above the Mediterranean, etc).
  This applies even after the semester is over.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Working in lock-step with other students. Your workflow should not involve a
  group of people identifying, tackling, and effectively identically solving a
  sequence of subproblems.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We have advanced cheating detection software, and we will routinely run this
code to detect cheating. Every semester, we catch and penalize a significant
number of people (roughly 100 cases per semester). Do not be one of them. If you
find
yourself at such a point of total desperation that cheating begins to look
attractive, contact one of the instructors and we can maybe help somehow.
Likewise, if 61B is causing massive disruption to your personal life, please
contact us directly.</p>

<p>If you admit guilt to an act of plagiarism before we catch you, you will be
given zero points on that assignment, and we will not refer your case to the
university administration.</p>

<p>Obviously, the expressive power of Java is a subset of the English language. And
yes, you can obviously obey the letter of this entire policy while completely
violating its spirit. However, this policy is not a game to be defeated, and
such circumventions will be seen as plagiarism.</p>

<h3 id="lateness">Lateness</h3>
<p>The expected deadlines for each assignment are posted on the class website. Our
assumption is that you will complete each assignment by its due date.</p>

<p>However, we understand that life gets in the way, and especially with the
Coronavirus, unexpected circumstances may arise.</p>

<p>It is possible to submit work late by requesting an “extension token” for 
the assignment using beacon at <a href="https://beacon.datastructur.es/extensions/">https://beacon.datastructur.es/extensions/</a>. The system will grant an extension
token as long as:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You have not used up your slip time.</li>
  <li>The extension is for less than 72 hours.</li>
</ol>

<p>Every student will starts with a total of 15 days worth of slip time that can be
used on homeworks, labs, or projects (including gold points assignments).</p>

<p>For example, consider a student who has:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Submitted HW2 3 hours late.</li>
  <li>Submitted Project 2A 35 hours late.</li>
  <li>Submitted Lab 7 16 hours late.</li>
  <li>Realizes four days after the deadline that they forgot to submit Project 2A.</li>
</ol>

<p>This student has used 2.25 of their slip days and they have 12.75 remaining.
This student will be unable to submit project 2A, because it is already more
than 3 days late, and will therefore receive a score of zero on project 2A.</p>

<p>Slip days are intended to cover life events and disability accomodations.
Students who have dire life circumstances that require additional time beyond
the 15 slip days should contact Akshit if their supply becomes too
low, and additional slip days may be granted if appropriate.</p>

<p>In addition to slip days, during RRR week, there will also be an amnesty period
where students may resubmit up to <strong>two assignments</strong> without penalty. For
example, the student in the example above will be able to submit project 2A
during the RRR week period. We will not grant amnesty for more than two
assignments. The details of the amnesty submissions will be given at a later
date.</p>

<h2 id="auditing-cs61b">Auditing CS61B</h2>
<p>This is for students who are unofficially auditing this class. Maybe you are a
non-Berkeley student who wants to brush up on your programming knowledge or even
a high school student who wants to get a head start on your programming career.</p>

<p>You can follow along with our lectures and assignments, getting all the code
from our skeleton as described in lab 1. The only difference is that you won’t
have a CS61B GitHub repository, you’ll have to make your own.</p>

<p>We also have an autograder on Gradescope set up just for you! The Gradescope
course activation code is MB7ZPY. We’ll release the autograder for assignments
about 3 days after it is due for Berkeley students.</p>
