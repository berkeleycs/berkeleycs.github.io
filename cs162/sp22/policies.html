<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>
    The purpose of this course is to teach the design of operating systems and
    operating systems concepts that appear in other computer systems.
    Topics we will cover include concepts of operating systems,
    systems programming, networked and distributed systems, and storage systems,
    including multiple-program systems
    (processes, interprocess communication, and synchronization), memory allocation
    (segmentation, paging), resource allocation and scheduling, file systems, basic
    networking (sockets, layering, APIs, reliability), transactions,
    security, and privacy.
</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
<p>CS 61A, CS 61B, CS 61C, and CS 70. This means that you understand:
    <ul>
        <li>Data structures: arrays, linked lists, binary trees, and hashing</li>
        <li>Assembly language programming</li>
        <li>The C programming language</li>
        <li>Debugging C using GDB</li>
        <li>CPU caches and memory hierarchy</li>
        <li>Virtual memory as covered in CS 61C</li>
        <li>CPU pipelines and basic digital logic design</li>
        <li>Basic knowledge of random variables and probability distributions as covered in CS 70</li>
    </ul>
    The TAs will spend a small amount of time reviewing some of the material
    you are less likely to remember. We will assume that you either know the
    material that is supposed to be covered in those courses, or that you are
    willing to learn the material as necessary. We will not spend time in
    lecture covering any of this material.
    <b>Perhaps more important than formal prequisites, however, is experience
    and maturity with debugging large programs, designing and implementing
    useful abstractions, and computational problem solving in general. This
    class will exercise your skills in these areas.</b>
</p>
<p>
    If you feel that you would benefit from additional review of these
    prerequisites, we recommend using the following resources:

    2. Hennessy, John L. and Patterson, David A. <i>Computer Architecture:
        A Quantitative Approach</i>. 5th edition.
        <b>Although the main content of this book goes far more in-depth into
        computer architecture than you are expected to know for this class, the
        appendices provide an excellent overview of some of the prerequisites.
        Focus specifically on the sections below:</b>
    <ul>
        <li>2.1 and B.1 - B.4 (you can skip the sixth optimization in B.3)
            review caching, virtual memory, and memory hierarchies.</li>
        <li>C.1 - C.2 review CPU pipelines at the level of CS 61C.</li>
        <!--
        <li>This book is available at the Engineering Library on campus:
            <a href="http://oskicat.berkeley.edu/record=b18534483~S1">check
            OskiCat</a>.</li>
        <li>Other editions (some older, some newer) are also available at the
            Engineering Library.</li>
        -->
    </ul>
</p>

<h3 id="enrollment">Enrollment</h3>
<p>
    <b>Please do not email us or post on Piazza about the
    waitlist.</b> All decisions concerning appeals for enrolling in
    the course are made by CS departmental staff; the course staff
    have no say in the matter. If you have questions or concerns, feel
    free to contact the departmental staff.
</p>
<p>
    The course has an <b>early drop deadline</b> (second Friday of
    instruction). This is due to the large group component in this
    class.
</p>
<p>
    If you are finishing an incomplete this term, do <b>NOT</b> enroll in the course.
    Instead, please email the the course email cs162@eecs to coordinate your plan for finishing
    the incomplete. Similarly, if you are given the grade of I (incomplete) this term,
    you should not re-register in CS 162 in a future term to complete the incomplete,
    and you should instead coordinate with the instructor and head TA in a future term
    in order to finish your incomplete.
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, if you are finishing an incomplete this term, you <b>cannot</b> change
    any grades that you had in the gradebook in the semester you were given the incomplete.
</p>

<h3 id="grading">Grading</h3>
<p>
    At the end of the term, each student is assigned a score out of 100 points.
    It is determined as follows:
    <ul>
        <li>36% Exams</li>
        <li>36% Projects</li>
        <li>18% Homeworks</li>
        <li>10% Participation</li>
    </ul>

    All three projects will be equally weighted, and all
    homeworks will be equally weighted as well. Project 0 counts as a homework assignment since it is done individually.
</p>
<p>
    It is important that you attend discussion sections and get to
    know your TA. TAs will provide essential specifics on hands-on
    aspects of the course, including tools, techniques and concepts.
    In the past, TAs have bumped borderline grade cases up or down
    based on participation.
</p>
<p>
    Discussion attendance and design review attendance is mandatory
    and your cameras must be ON when in online discussion sections and
    design reviews. This will count towards your participation grade.
</p>
<p>
    Once students' raw scores are computed as described above, final
    grades are assigned using a curved scale in line with
    the <a href="https://eecs.berkeley.edu/resources/faculty-staff/academic-personnel/grading-guidelines-undergrad">department
    policy</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="lecture">Lecture</h3>
<p>
    Professors Kubiatowicz and Joseph will deliver lectures from
    3:30-5:00 PM in 2050 VLSB on Tuesdays and Thursdays.  During periods
    of virtual instruction (such as first two weeks of the term), we will use the zoom link
    provided <a href="https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/98473516803?pwd=NVBpSDZ3YzRDU3lGUzFjWkRCWFF2Zz09">HERE</a>.
    We may continue to utilize the zoom link at other times this term.
    We also plan to have screencast this term and will post lectures to
    the course schedule page.
</p>

<h3 id="readings">Readings</h3>
<p>
    We are using the textbook, &ldquo;Operating Systems: Principles
    and Practice&rdquo; by Anderson and Dahlin (A&amp;D). The reading
    from this textbook is <b>strongly recommended</b>. There will be
    some additional readings that are not from this textbook that are
    freely available online. These will be linked on the course
    website in the "Readings" column for your viewing.
</p>
<h4>Strongly Recommended</h4>

<h3 id="exams">Exams</h3>
<p>
    Three midterm exams will be scheduled without a final exam.
    Each midterm will focus on the material in projects and lectures
    in that third of the course, but all material from lectures,
    discussions, readings, homeworks, and projects up to that point
    are in scope. <b>You are likely to do poorly on the exams and in
    the course if you do not do your share of the work on the
    project.</b>
</p>
<p>
    Check the schedule on the front page for exam dates and
    times. If you have a conflict, please let us know using the conflict form
    linked on the schedule, and we will do our best to schedule a makeup. 
    You must have a valid reason for a conflict (e.g. other exams)</b>.
    All exams will be <b>closed book</b> with the exception of a certain number
    of cheatsheets which will be determined prior to the exam.
</p>
<p>
    Each exam will hold equal weight in the your overall grade.
</p>
<p>
    If you have a DSP accommodation for exams, we will contact you
    prior to each midterm. Please reach out to us if we do not.
</p>
<p>
    Unlike recent terms, Exams will be <i>in person</i>, unless Berkeley
    is closed for virtual instruction.
</p>

<h3 id="homeworks">Homeworks</h3>
<p>
    The homeworks and projects in this class are a great way to get hands-on
    experience building systems. We have tried hard to keep the workload manageable
    and to focus on learning concepts, rather than busy work.
</p>
<p>
    Homeworks and projects will all be submitted and autograded via GitHub.
    Individuals and groups will have course-provided GitHub repositories.
    Intermediate pushes will help the staff see how students are progressing.
</p>
<p>
    We see homework mostly as a chance for exercise. Solutions will not be made
    available online, but you may come to Office Hours to see them 2 days after
    all possible slip days on the assignment have expired.
    
</p>

<h3 id="projects">Projects</h3>
<p>
    We will be using the Pintos educational operating system for all four projects
    this term. The projects in this course provide a deep experience with operating system
    and distributed system design and implementation. The project experience is
    essential to the course.
</p>
<p>
    If you plan to do software or hardware development after
    graduation, you will almost certainly need to know how to work in
    a group. Recent CS grads almost all say that the ability to work
    in groups was the single most important thing they wished they had
    learned at Berkeley. Hence, for these projects, <b>you will need
    to form into groups of 4 people</b>. <i>We will not permit anyone
    to do the projects in a group smaller than 3, and we will only
    permit a few groups to have a size of three, if the class is not
    evenly divisible by 4.</i> <b>All projects will be a group effort
    excluding Project 0.</b> The assignments will be the same no
    matter what size group you have. In order to ensure everyone in
    the group does their fair share of the work, we will ask each of
    you to turn in assessments of the relative contributions of your
    project partners. These assessments are important, and they can
    have a <i>substantial</i> impact on your grade if you do not
    participate.
</p>
<p>
    TAs will grade all parts of your project. The TAs have been instructed to grade
    in part on design. In other words, it is <b>not</b> enough to get a working solution;
    you must implement the solution in a clean way that would simplify making further
    enhancements. (Several employers in the area have said that many of our graduates
    don&rsquo;t know how to program well &mdash; it will really benefit you in the
    long run to work on your software engineering skills.)
</p>
<p>
    For each project, you will turn in an initial design document and a TA will meet
    with your group for an oral presentation of your design at a <b>design review</b>.
    These reviews serve several purposes:
</p>
    <ol>
        <li>To encourage you to get an early start on the assignments (a key to success
            in this course).</li>
        <li>To catch design errors early, <b>before</b> you spend a lot of time debugging.</li>
        <li>To give you an opportunity to explain and defend your approach (this is an
            important skill to learn as engineers).</li>
        <li>To provide an opportunity to assess your understanding of the project.</li>
    </ol>

    Participation in these design reviews will be factored into your
    participation grade. Following the review, you will turn in the
    actual project code to GitHub, which will be graded by our
    autograder.
</p>

<h3 id="discussions">Discussions</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Discussion attendance is mandatory</strong> and will be a
    portion of your grade (see Grading). We will assign groups after
    the Early Drop Deadline, so you are free to explore different
    sections for the first two discussions. However, starting from the
    third discussion, you will be required to attend your assigned
    section, which all of your project group will be assigned to.
    There will be a group registration form to determine your
    availability and preferences to ensure your entire group will be
    able to make it to the same section.
    
    All discussion sections will be online for the first two weeks.
</p>

<h3 id="extensions">Extensions</h3>
<p>
    All assignments are due at 11:59:00 PM Pacific Time on the day
    listed on the schedule unless otherwise specified.
</p>
<p>
    Your group gets <b>4</b> project &ldquo;slip days&rdquo;. Project slip days can
    <b>not</b> be used for Project 0 or design docs
    submissions. <b>Design docs will get a score of 0 if submitted
    after the deadline.</b> After the project slip days are used up,
    you will no longer be able to submit a project late and your score
    on the late project will not change.
</p>
<p>
    There are <b>3</b> homework &ldquo;slip days&rdquo;. Project 0
    will use homework slip days instead of project slip days, since it
    is an individual assignment. After the homework slip days are used
    up, you will no longer be able to submit a homework late and your
    score on the late homework will not change.
</p>
<p>
    Slip days can only be used in whole numbers. Although no credit
    will be given for submissions after slip days have expired,
    we <i>may</i> be lenient in special circumstances, and grant
    manual extensions on assignments at our discretion. <b>However, it
    is your responsibility to distribute your slip days throughout the
    semester, so make sure to save these for emergency situations.</b>
    Please stay in touch with your TA and keep them updated on any
    circumstances that may lead you to submit a homework or project
    late.
</p>
<p>
    DSP students and other students facing extenuating circumstances
    can request extensions through the extensions form linked at the navbar.
    <b>Please make sure to request extensions in a timely manner; we may not
    be able to give you a response if you make a request very close to the
    deadline.</b>
</p>

<h3 id="piazza">Piazza</h3>
<p>
    Piazza will
    be the main mode of communication. It is your responsibility to
    check Piazza on a frequent basis to make sure you're up to date on
    important logistics.
</p>
<p>
    The following rules are in place to keep Piazza organized. <b>Any
    violation of the rules may result in your post being removed.</b>
</p>
<h4>Posts</h4>
<p>
    Prior to making a Piazza post, make sure you've spent some time trying to tackle the problem on your own. These include
    <ul>
        <li>Reading through similar posts/follow-ups</li>
        <li>Searching the internet for help (within the rules of integrity)</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h4>Format</h4>
<p>
    Make sure the title is of the form &ldquo;[Folder] Title&rdquo;
    where folder is one of the folder names. This helps us recognize
    what the post is about right away! In the body of your post, you
    should make sure to include
    <ul>
        <li>A clear and concise description of the problem</li>
        <li>What you believe is causing the problem</li>
        <li>Some of the things you've done to try to resolve the problem</li>
    </ul>
    Please format your question in a legible way! If using any code,
    make sure to use the code formatter and similarly for math
    equations. Check out
    Piazza's <a href="https://support.piazza.com/support/solutions/articles/48000964938-text-editor-options-student">text
    editor options</a> or use markdown!
</p>
<h4>Public</h4>
<p>
    There should be a very small number of public posts regarding
    content. Please ask questions as follow-ups on appropriate threads
    for each homework, project, discussion, or lecture. There will
    inevitably be some posts about logistics, but these should be
    posted as follow-ups as well whenever possible.
</p>
<p>
    One of the primary reason for students posting as a public post
    instead of in a thread is to make sure their post gets visibility.
    However, follow-ups and public posts get the same amount of
    visibility from staff because we will monitor posts by filtering
    &ldquo;Unresolved follow-ups&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Do not follow-up with &ldquo;+1&rdquo; on posts and instead use
    the &ldquo;helpful!&rdquo; or &ldquo;good question/note&rdquo;
    buttons instead.</b> Make sure to resolve and unresolve questions
    appropriately.
</p>
<h4>Private</h4>
<p>
    Debugging private posts are not allowed under any circumstances since
    staff does not have the capacity to answer them. Only logistical private
    posts are allowed.
</p>
<h4>Inclusivity</h4>
<p>
    Any content on public forums like Piazza that similarly targets,
    excludes, disrespects or discriminates against a certain
    individual or community will be removed and the person responsible
    for the content will face repercussions. Please aim to keep the
    climate inclusive for everyone.
</p>
<p>
    If at any point you have felt targeted, excluded, disrespected, or
    discriminated against by a student or someone from course staff,
    please report the incident with any member of course staff that
    you are comfortable with or the Head TAs or professor. If you
    would rather not speak to someone from staff, consider contacting
    the ASUC Student Advocate’s Office.
</p>

<h3 id="collaboration">Collaboration</h3>

<span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">
    Projects are a shared responsiblity and all project members will incur penalties
    for cheating. You are accountable for the actions of your teammates.
</span>
<p>
    Maintaining academic integrity is a crucial part of your learning experience, as cheating
    prevents us as instructors from understanding where our model of instruction isn’t working.
    We encourage you to ask other students <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">
    in this semester&rsquo;s course</span> about the concepts, algorithms, or approaches
    needed to do the projects and assignments; both giving and taking advice will help
    you to learn. However, what you turn in must be your own, or for projects, your
    group&rsquo;s own work; copying other people&rsquo;s code, solution sets, or from
    any other sources, including online sources, is strictly prohibited. The project
    assignments must be the work of the students turning them in. Wherever you have
    benefited from the work of others, you should credit it properly in your code
    and/or writeup. Note: Only projects are group assignments. Homeworks are individual
    and you should not look at or copy other code, even that of your project groupmates.
</p>
<p>
    Examples of
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">acceptable</span> collaboration between
    students in different project groups
    <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">in this semester&rsquo;s course</span>:
</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Explaining a concept to another student, or asking another student to explain
            a concept to you</li>
        <li>Discussing various algorithms or approaches for project components</li>
        <li>Discussing testing strategies and approaches</li>
        <li>Searching online for algorithms or implementations of generic (non-project-specific)
            abstractions (e.g., searching for various implementations of a hash table)</li>
        <li>Helping another student with high-level debugging approaches <span style="color: red;">
            (note that it is <span style="font-weight: bold;">not</span> acceptable to
            give that student code solutions or even look at their code, as described below)</span></li>
    </ul>
<p>
    Examples of
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">unacceptable</span> collaboration:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Looking at code from a different group&rsquo;s project or another student&rsquo;s
            homework &mdash; this includes looking at online code from prior semesters
            or other institutions</li>
        <li>Using code from a different group&rsquo;s project or another student&rsquo;s
            homework &mdash; this includes incorporating online code from prior semesters
            or other institutions</li>
        <li>Looking at or using specific test case instances from a different group&rsquo;s project
            or another student&rsquo;s homework &mdash; this includes incorporating online code
            from prior semesters or other institutions</li>
        <li>Searching online for specific implementations of project abstractions or functions</li>
    </ul>
<p>
    We use an automated system for detecting cheating: it performs a pairwise comparison
    of all assignment submissions with all others for this class, prior semester classes,
    and various online repositories. The system reports any suspicious similarities. The
    course staff will manually review any such similarities. Moreover, we have a dedicated
    staff of readers who will manually review code, and note similarities between algorithms
    and designs used in other students solutions as well as any solutions available online.
    Do <b>NOT</b> try to fool our automatic cheating detection system, because you WILL be caught
    by our human readers.
</p>
<p>
    Note that you are responsible for not leaving copies of your assignments lying
    around and for protecting your files &mdash; do not use public unprotected source
    code repositories to store your code. You must set up your files and directories
    so that they are protected from others reading them.
</p>
<p>
    Any mechanisms used in attempt to "hardcode" solutions to homeworks or projects will
    be punishable as cheating cases. We reserve the right to evaluate submitted code on
    our private test suites which can detect hardcoded solutions, and our readers
    may manually inspect your code solution for any such instances of cheating.
</p>
<p>
    If two assignments are determined to be obviously very similar (i.e., we believe
    that they were done together or one was copied from the other), then all the students
    involved the incident, both the copy-er and the copy-ee, will receive a penalty. The
    minimum penalty is to receive a negative score on the assignment. More serious cases of
    academic dishonesty, such as repeat offences or cheating on exams, will incur a greater
    penalty at the instructor's discretion, such as receiving an F in the class. In addition,
    for every instance, a letter to the Center of Student Conduct will be attached to your
    permanent record, and a copy will be placed in the CS division office.

    <b>This course is challenging. If you ever feel tempted to resort to academic dishonesty
    to meet a deadline, please don't. Contact your TA instead, they are here to help!</b>

<h3 id="office-hours">Office Hours</h3>
<p>
    All staff members will host office hours throughout the week.
    Professor office hours are meant for conceptual questions from
    lecture. Any questions or debugging help regarding assignments
    should be directed towards TA and reader office hours.
</p>
<p>
    Like posting on Piazza, we expect you to have put in substantial
    effort to debug before coming to office hours.
</p>
<h4>Format</h4>
<p>
    For the first two weeks, office hours will be held online. Please
    visit the OH Queue linked at the top to queue yourself up for office
    hours. In between OH, the queue may be cleared to ensure fairness.
    
    If you would like individual help from
    a staff member, then please fill out a ticket on the OH Queue.
    Make sure that you have <strong>filled out the ticket template in
    detail</strong> or we may skip your ticket.
