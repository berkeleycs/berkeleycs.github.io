    <p>As you may have seen, <strong>our (u)GSI/reader/tutor union recently called a strike starting Monday, November 14th, 8:00 AM</strong> in coordination with the student researcher, postdoc, and academic researcher unions. All four of our unions have been negotiating with UC for</p>

<ul>
  <li>better pay to end rent burden</li>
  <li>annual cost-of-living adjustments</li>
  <li>protections against bullying, harassment, and discrimination</li>
  <li>free transit</li>
  <li>many other improvements to our working conditions</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tdWCJDoHUAVBslgD2OxjvbUvO2O1sMTf/view">Here in EECS specifically, we’re demanding that UC hire more course staff (at least 50% higher than Fall 2022 levels) to alleviate systemic overwork and improve teaching, and we’re demanding that fee remissions be funded by UC instead of by the department.</a></strong> Unfortunately, it is the Union’s position that UC has not been bargaining in good faith (<a href="https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/UAW">UC denies that claim</a>); instead, they have delayed, refused to negotiate, circumvented the bargaining process, and refused to provide even basic information, like how much the raises we’re asking for would cost them. We’re going on strike to force UC to end these unfair labor practices and to ask that they bargain with us in good faith for a fair contract.</p>

<p>Now is an unprecedented time when we have the power to effect real change to improve teaching and research here in EECS and across the UC system. <strong>UC has systematically underfunded teaching in our department, leading to major caps, long OH queues, course staff overwork, and overall poor teaching outcomes. Strong EECS participation in the strike is the only way to win the increased staffing and centralized fee remissions</strong> mentioned above. Regretfully, the strike will disrupt course structure this semester. However, we see going on strike as the only remaining way to put teaching in our department back on the right track in the long term. <strong>For those of you who are on course staff for other courses, we urge you to fully participate in the strike, sign up for shifts on the picket line, and help organize your course staff. We need your organizing help to make this strike successful.</strong></p>

<p>We want to emphasize that this is not a “students vs TAs” or “students vs union” conflict. The purpose is to improve working conditions and staffing, which will in turn benefit students as well.</p>

<ul>
  <li>TAs and readers will not be participating in student facing operations for the duration of the strike. What does this mean exactly?
    <ul>
      <li>Discussion sections will be canceled.</li>
      <li>TA and reader office hours and project and homework parties will be canceled.</li>
      <li>TAs and readers will not be responding to course related questions on Ed or over email, however, we may be able to answer questions strictly pertaining to the strike.</li>
      <li>TAs and readers will not be grading during the strike.</li>
      <li>We don’t know how long the strike will last, but Peyrin will do his best to keep you updated.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>We will be implementing the following logistics changes to mitigate student stress:
    <ul>
      <li>HW 9 deadline postponed while the strike is ongoing, tentatively to Wednesday the 16th</li>
      <li>HW 10 release and deadline are postponed</li>
      <li>Peyrin can hold limited OH for emergencies/urgent questions only (i.e. not replacing normal OH, which are canceled) from 6:30-8pm Tu/Th, and 5-6:30pm M/W, online-only.</li>
      <li>Everyone will get participation credit for 1 discussion attendance for this week</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Other Announcements
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Lecture is moved online to Zoom</strong>, and recordings will be posted.</li>
      <li>Project 5 is released and is due on Tuesday, Nov. 29</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you’d like to visit those on the picket line next week, EECS will be picketing at Hearst and Leroy! I encourage all of you to spend some of this time educating yourself about the strike, why it is happening, and how it can impact the university.
