In order for your peers to see your edits, you need to SAVE (CTRL/CMD + s) and ask your peers to reload their version. (You have your own copies of each python variable, etc. but the underlying IPython file is shared)\n",

    "For the first half of Problem 1a, you were asked to solve systems of two equations. Now we will develop some graphical intuition for these problems. Each equation can be rewritten as $ax+by=c$ and thus describes a line in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Therefore, the solution to the system of equations must lie on the lines described by the system of equations (convince yourselves why this is the case).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next few blocks, there is code to graph two lines. Play around with the parameters $a1,b1,\\ldots,c2$ to create different lines. Change the parameters to describe the system of equations from parts i-iii. For each part use the graphs to explain the results you found in Problem 1a parts i-iii."
